shorts and flip-flops so obviously moving to Singapore has had some effect um usually it\'s flip-flops so it\'s the last time that I first time that Bali has been wearing a jacket and I haven\'t rather than the other way round um so I don\'t think we have a particularly narrow remmit here power and technology and progress and how everything is going to change i thought um and sort of part of the theme I think of what Bali was saying earlier and in a sense of what I was saying earlier as well is how different AI is but also to think about how many times we\'ve had everything changed before like how the internet changed everything and plenty of other technologies before that and I thought something interesting to talk about to begin with would be that the internet was going to be wonderful and amazing and great and it was going to end human suffering and connect everybody in the world and it turned out in the \'90s that it connected everybody and that meant you could be the only gay person in the village and you\'d meet other gay people and it turned out it also meant you could be the only Nazi in the village and meet other Nazis and like the sort of there was a degree to which the internet changed everything but also in which a degree to which sort of humanity reverted to the mean and we discovered that social media wasn\'t completely 100% good and the and so on and I just think it\'s kind of interesting to think about that and to think about all the ways that maybe AI will again revert to the meme to to the meme and bring out all of humanity\'s worst instincts as well as the best instincts it\'s funny i would say that uh I actually think the way I think about it is the internet increases variance and what that means is more upside and more downside in everything and the mechanics of that is actually not so much reverting to the mean it\'s actually removing in every situation the mediator the moderator the middleman right the moderate and uh sometimes it\'s good and sometimes it\'s bad a middleman is taking a tax on things maybe you don\'t want that sometimes you know the moderator is you know a choke point centralizing sometimes they\'re keeping the peace but what it means is that all the kind of choke points on society gone and every node can connect to every other node so all these extreme nodes extremely good and extremely bad pop out there and so you\'re you\'re summing an equation that has these hugely positive terms like using AI to solve you know protein folding like what Deise you know has done and you know just amazing technological breakthroughs uh and then you have obviously really horrible things and it\'s very hard to sum an equation that has these very positive and negative things but I think ballpark it\'s not so much regressing to the mean it\'s actually the opposite it\'s like diverging in both directions from it yeah it\'s it\'s it\'s one of the ways I used to sort of talk to regulators about the internet was to say like um you\'re seeing all of humanity being expressed and channeled and amplified in new ways there was a a sort of a story from the UK when there was lots of violence around football matches that Margaret Thatcher said to the head of the football association why are your fans causing all these problems and he said they\'re your voters that kind of what we\'re seeing here is the expression of humanity in in in kind of new and different ways um one of the um sort of sort of things that maybe expresses that is I was sort of thinking that my my my some people may know my grandfather was a influential science fiction writer in the 50s which means science fiction writers have heard of him but I don\'t get any money um and quite a lot of his stories you see first of all the sort of classic stories it\'s um rocket ships and societies on different planets but it\'s all white men flying the rocket ships and you fly the rocket ship but you have paper star charts and slide rules and you have to queue up to buy a paper ticket in order to fly to another planet and it it\'s kind of whenever you kind of go back and look at predictions of how every new technology is going to get used it\'s always well it\'s going to be our own society in the issues that we have now um but with this new thing and what actually happens is that we kind of we get changes in different places in different axes in different directions and I\'m wondering how how much are we kind of not predicting what the internet\'s going to be or what AI now what AI is going to be we just said we\'ll have all the same stuff but with AI and how much is actually going to be different from that do you think yeah i mean in a sense AI turbocharges what the internet already does it it puts it on steroids and maybe one of the issues I find interesting especially coming from the world of politics is we ask it questions and what do we do when we don\'t like the answers and most of the time now we\'re going to get answers we don\'t like as in you must change or you know the the Whimo robo taxi comes and picks you up to take you to work but informs you that we\'re going to the hospital because it\'s already concluded that you\'re about to have a heart attack and you need medical attention right now and what\'s your acceptance rate right like do you argue with it do you say that\'s ridiculous i\'m perfectly fine or are you grateful that you\'re being forewarned i think this is one of the huge issues is it\'s going to inform us that many of the decisions we make are on very unound basis um that\'s the nature of the human condition and so if we don\'t like it we may find it\'s more efficient it\'s more profitable but it\'s challenging our notion of free will and decision-m and I think that\'s a big struggle that we\'re already seeing you sort of the question is why do you want the better answer is it to make life better or is it because you\'re trying to make the performance of the company or the country improve for this quarter to get the votes or to get the share price up if it\'s the latter then we are going to be in a constant difficult situation so one of the things I\'m always focused on is you know we ask what is it to be an AI we\'re asking this all the time now but we\'re not asking so much what is the nature of being human and and what can we do to protect and preserve our humanity as we build these systems that help us have better quality decision-making but the definition of better is yet unressed so there are all these fantasies from if you kind of go back and look at the sort of 50s and 60s that you\'ll be able to build like a government center that has a database and then you\'ll just have the right answers to everything and it turned out that you could have a lot more data but actually the underlying differences of opinion of like should you have more employment rights um or should you have faster economic growth generally don\'t have right answers they have questions of emphasis or opinion or priority where different people can disagree um and you don\'t have one answer you have questions about what you might want i don\'t think software doesn\'t necessarily change that but it it kind of shifts how we discuss those things doesn\'t it 100% so again as someone who spent many years in financial markets and people ask me should I buy fill-in- thelank crypto equities bonds right what what should I buy as if there\'s a universal answer to that but then my question to you is well do you already have crypto a lot or a little do you already have equities a lot or a little in other words the the risk is our own it\'s individual but the system doesn\'t like that answer because that\'s not scalable if I\'m a financial institution I want to give everybody in this room the same answer and I want to sell you all the same product at the same time but the reality is each one of us have different risk appetites different risk profiles and I think one of the good things that an artificial intelligenceled world will do is facilitate each of us expressing our individual preferences without being funneled into these universal answers applied as if we\'re all exactly the same because we\'re not everyone has their unique aspects of who they are as a human so you know you me in their first question you asked about you know this technology of the internet we thought it was going to be great it\'s not always so great i think all technologies are the same you know you can use the automobile to safely transport your family or you can use it to wipe out a family everything it cuts both ways so it\'s all about how we use it and that\'s why for me I keep saying we are the technology all these things we\'re talking about artificial intelligence robotics automation these are like prosthetics that are expanding our capacity to execute and do things but we are inventing them we are creating this stuff so you are the technology so linking maybe both of those i just have one thought on on your earlier point on uh why you had rockets with cues i think it\'s relatively easy to extrapolate out each individual technology like rays of you know light going out like rockets will get better phones will get better and so on and so forth but it\'s hard to model the interaction effects and for example video games getting better social networks getting better but these produce the data and these produce the GPUs that trained AI right another interaction effect that I think about a lot is drones getting better and I know we\'ll argue about this but crypto getting better and the thing is that most backends are hacked like the Pentagon is hacked over and over again most government systems are hacked blockchains are not hacked that means that the control plane for the drones will be onchain like that\'s the only genuinely secure backend like Bitcoin Ethereum Salon those are not hacked whereas government systems are so just like people thought video games were not that important social media was not that important but they provided the data and the compute for something that became all important with AI these like little flying drone cameras now people understand drones are important crypto people understand I think that that\'s important but the interaction effect of those I think is going to be very material in the medium term there\'s a um there\'s a fascinating grand corporation study from the 60s that tried to do kind of long-term forecasting and they did these surveys of dozens of experts and produced kind of bell curves of when people think thought would h things would happen and it\'s everything from like machine translation to automatic doctors I talked earlier about AI as being a word-like technology automatic is another one like no one talks about automatic anymore more because it just happened like we don\'t get into an elevator and say I\'m going to use an automatic elevator now so when would you have automatic driving when would would you have automatic translation automatic doctors automatic filing of your taxes and the funny thing about this is like there\'s the obvious point that they thought we\'d have colonies on Mars by now and we don\'t but that everything is in the wrong order and so you look at the sequence now and you think well they thought that we would have like the NSA could listen to all of our phone conversations by 2050 but we would have colonies on Mars now and we would have had machine translation working perfectly in 1980 and when you kind of look at the sequencing what it is is they thought each of those would be point solutions and didn\'t understand that first you\'d have general purpose computing and then you\'d have software on top and everyone would have a computer and then this would happen and then that would happen so the sequencing is like no one will get a newspaper faxed to their home until like the year 2050 but everyone would have perfect machine translation in 1980 and not realize like it\'s the other way round you have to have that first and then you have this um I was just what I was going to sort of picking up on both of your your two previous answers one of the things that I spent a lot of time talking about to kind of marketers and retailers and people in advertising is that before the internet you had very limited amount of media very limited amount of retail very limited amount of product and so like only so many people could buy the back page of Vogue only so many people could do a nationwide TV ad there was only so much inventory in most retailers even a department store so there were these kind of constraints on what you could buy and what you could know about and with the internet you basically have infinite media and infinite product and you have no idea what to buy and Amazon has a has whatever it is 500 million SKs and then there\'s infinite advertising on Instagram or Google or YouTube or whatever it is and so there\'s one question which is exactly kind of Bali\'s point about like you have this infinite variance like instead of you having this kind of narrow concentration on what you buy now that explodes and there all these different nodes and different tribes and different interest groups or interest graphs or whatever you want to call it and the same thing kind of in politics that there used to be this kind of constraint on most countries you kind of focused in on kind of two bell curves on the chart there\'s a kind of a bell curve sort of center left and there\'s a bell curve center right and the internet has kind of exploded all of those and now now it looks much more like proportional representation and you have these kind of many more different kind of political tribes all those coalitions kind of broke apart um one of the things I was sort of wondering about generative AI particularly as I look at retailing and brands is you know what happens if I can kind of just wave my phone at my at my living room and say "Right what holiday should I buy?" Like you can see my home okay so what kind of hotel would I like in Rome or maybe I should go on Safari like how much did the does the ability of a machine to see everything and build patterns across everything again change how we think about what we what we might like change how mass culture might work change how our political preferences might work because we get this kind of new layer of understanding and aggregation sorry I\'m waving my hands a lot um but it\'s kind of a very handwavy sort of question um suddenly we have this new thing that isn\'t Google or Instagram that sort of understands everything and that might be politics it might be what what might what we might want to buy it might be how we choose a bank well the way I think about it is uh like the garden of intelligent things so your fridge is also your nutritionist and your um your your oven is also your cook and that will just order ingredients for you tell you how to prepare it and it might be specialized or domain locked to the area where it\'s you know kind of got data or what have you um your robot dog can talk to you um it\'s interesting you know have you ever been to Dubai\'s Museum of the Future no no okay yeah have you have been there yeah have you seen the uh one of the things they did there that I didn\'t realize how good it was is they took robots and clad them so that they have like a they have a drone but they\'ve got like a puffer fish like uh thing around it and that really changes your perception of the object it\'s kind of like the the drone by itself is like a skeleton but with this flesh so to speak around it it like actually kind of feels like an animal of some kind right and it really you should go and check it out and they\'ve got a few different things that are like this and I think that that\'s almost um it\'s like putting a user interface on top of a website it just totally changes your perception of what it feels like and so you\'ll have all these kinds of animals that\'ll talk to you and do things uh and I think almost like a like a I don\'t know one of these magical novels or whatever so actually this is really interesting to me because my first uh venture into the robotics world was helping to co-ound a robotics company that was making drones which is about 10 years ago and it\'s to your question of space of adoption and what I learned from that experience was at the time everybody\'s like what\'s a drone like really only 10 years ago people didn\'t know what a drone was and they didn\'t know why would I need one And I was we were trying to sell industrial drones gathering industrial data for like construction sites or you know farming and even though you could make the case as to how it would save them money it would be better safety for their personnel and the whole list they couldn\'t do it until their peers started to do it it it made me realize human beings are such social creatures and so to your point why do we have this weird adoption pace it it\'s not consistent with what is possible and the answer is because human beings have one constraint which is lack of imagination and that\'s combined with the need to be accepted and so people get afraid it\'s exactly what Ed Snowden was just talking about i just tweeted out in fact the an original quote that I picked up on this same subject which was Frank Zappa the musician and he said progress only happens when you deviate from the mean and so technology by nature can\'t progress very quickly because it\'s only the people who are deviating from the mean that are running with it and then the average it\'s really about socializing the concept cept it\'s not does it work or do I need it or will it actually make my you know profits go up you would think those would be compelling enough but they\'re not it is are my peers using it I mean the thing is at the beginning of World War I if I recall they were still doing you know horse and cavalry charges and that actually had to get cut turbons by machine guns before they abandoned that and I think just even the fact that we have human militaries now is actually partly a function of a A lot of military budgets are based around oh you know this is the piece of equipment I\'m using i\'m using an aircraft carrier i\'m an aircraft carrier guy i\'m a I\'m a tank guy i\'m a this guy it\'s kind of like um and even the movies are still you know Top Gun Infinity or whatever number it\'s on nothing against Tom Cruz it\'s still talking about manned flight and whatnot whereas everything is going to go unmanned it\'s all going to be drones it\'s all going to be you know self-driving it\'s all going to be um you know humanoids and that\'s going to be fighting robot wars i mean that\'s like completely obvious uh but uh you know obviously the cost curve has to get there for some of these things some of them it\'s already there like Ukraine and Russia are already just fighting drone wars um Israel is fighting a drone war right now with Iran um but but the current I mean the issue is that current institutions don\'t have any incentive to self-disrupt that\'s why new entrance generally tend to come in in fact in my talk about uh this afternoon after this I\'m going to talk a bit about space and why we\'re spending so much money going into space but people have it in their heads this is about human beings it\'s about astronauts and why because NASA gets their allocations from Congress based on heroes they have to create these heroes but the fact is the future of space is about self assembling self-replicating robotics that are either fully autonomous certainly AI led remotely controlled at times and that\'s what will do the buildout and not just for the lunar surface or in orbit but beyond but that doesn\'t resonate with Congress allocating money to robots doesn\'t resonate with to heroic astronauts so it\'s a huge mindset well I mean it\'s interesting to be in Singapore and talking about drones because for Americans the iconic moment is Pearl Harbor but if you go back and look at the all the debate about aircraft in the previous 20 years no one would have really had a problem with the idea that you could sink a battleship at anchor in a harbor the whole intellectual question was can you sink a capital ship at sea when it\'s doing 30 knots and can turn and can shoot back and it turned out actually to be really hard to do that the Japanese managed it you know half a day sailing from here when they sank two British capital ships which is the first time anybody had sunk a capital ship at sea the irony is that the Japanese strategy for the war was not aircraft and aircraft carriers they thought it was going to end up as a big battle between American and Japanese battleships which in the end never happened there was no such battle um but the interesting thing is the debate before in the previous 20 years and there was all this argument about are you going to be able to do this and it wasn\'t clear that you would there were lots of people who thought you wouldn\'t the Japanese weren\'t clear that you were going to be able to do this um and then there was this kind of great catalytic moment when they discovered that this was possible and all the world\'s navies kind of suddenly had to reorient around this new technology and you know in classic you know technology cliche this was disruptive because you go from a battleship that fires um a broadside of shells 20 miles to an aircraft that can carry one shell more or less two or 300 miles well yeah i mean the new entrance for example India land an uh landed an unmanned probe on the dark side of the moon and it did it very cheaply because it didn\'t have didn\'t have it didn\'t have enough money so it had to do it cheaply and so it wasn\'t obsessed with a manned mission it was able to move forward and um you know like for example the Houthis in you know the the Red Sea are at like 1,000 the cost structure political talk about a $2 million US missile versus $2,000 drone so um they are or even the aircraft carrier example the capitalist ships you just mentioned Hexet who\'s the defense secretary has mentioned that Chinese hypersonics can basically sink all US aircraft carriers and some at least one US aircraft carrier evidently had to retreat or at least had to go back for extended maintenance that\'s that\'s the story at least they\'re saying maybe it\'s just maintenance maybe it\'s actually more than that um after the engagement in the Red Sea so in many ways like some of these things are already kind of obsolete but until it\'s like actually sunk then it\'s not like marked to market in some sense um I don\'t know maybe maybe there\'s there\'s always a sort of a whole history of military technology is that it always gets more expensive and the fact that each generation is more expensive itself tends to be disruptive and narrows in who can do it and then someone comes in with something cheaper that sabotages the whole system yeah you had this thing about like uh something reaches perfection just as it\'s obsolete what was that thing something like that yeah I think I I wrote something about this years ago it\'s like you you know you you you you get the perfect propeller powered aircraft just as jets arrive you get the perfect battleships just as um aircraft carriers arrive and we\'re sort of you get the kind of the platonic ideal of a thing once it\'s become obsolete right but we\'re at a very interesting moment right now because something really profound has happened in the in the military defense space which is you know in the old days if you spend a lot of money on defense equipment that bought you security but when I was in the White House on 911 we realized that $5 box cutters overwhelmed all of our defense capability literally and today we\'re seeing these extremely inexpensive drones in variety of different methodologies the warheads on foreheads to all sorts of examples so suddenly all that huge money that you\'ve spent on physical defense capability is got a huge question mark over it and so it forces us to think creatively and people are starting to realize that maybe the most valuable piece of defense equipment is a 3D printer it\'s not a weapon system as you usually think it\'s the capacity to create on the go and that requires a total change for the people who think about defense that\'s not how they\'re used to thinking there\'s a um there\'s a classic joke about LLMs that basically half of LLMs will be turning three bullet points into an email and the other half will be turning an email into three bullet points and now that seems to apply to drones that half of the you basically will be having our drones shooting down their drones um and why would it why would it be a 3D printer so for example one of the considerations right now is can you build if you have a conflict can you build hospital facilities very quickly 3D printing icon type buildings another is drones can you 3D print a lot of drones really fast you can 3D print small drones I think it\'s hard to 3D print buildings but we\'re heading in the well I disagree the Chinese are showing us that they can do hospitals in a week now may last long the quality may not be okay well so I guess the mechanics in a conflict environment where you\'re it\'s the equivalent of the tent in Vietnam you know how fast can you pitch a medical tent so suddenly you\'re looking at things that you didn\'t initially consider and by the way there\'s a long history of this in the defense space i mean we look at what was the most important innovation that allowed the creation of the largest empire in history which is the Genghaskhan Empire and the answer is metal stirrups and you\'re like wait metal stirrups why because all of a sudden you could put a human with ar with armor on and they didn\'t need to hold the horse because you can stand which means you can shoot your bow and arrow forward or backward now you have speed but if you ask someone in the military defense space um you know what\'s the innovation that will make the difference nobody would have guessed it\'s going to be metal stirrups all of this requires creative thinking i mean I\'ve spent some time over the last decade lecturing to the senior NATO generals and trying to bring this kind of thinking into their realm but these are very focused organizations that don\'t make a lot of time for that in fact fundamentally what I think AI is going to require is we\'re already good at analytics and now we\'re going to be amazing at analytics because AI augments us and that means spending more time on your creative side and that it\'s less good at and we\'re really good at photo shifting can I make one point so I think um one way of thinking about this is in terms of digital borders um that is to say I think we\'re going to eventually conceptualize I mean China\'s in some ways already there in a sense China and crypto take the internet seriously because they\'ve got the great firewall and the blockchain respectively which are like defensive structures on the internet in very different ways but digital borders will be as important as physical borders because if you don\'t have digital borders somebody can script a drone in your territory and blow something up and so then that changes the debate over what nodes can connect to what other nodes like is it pure internet free speech is there some moderation who is a moderator what kind of level of moderation is legitimate and I think that um like the entire concept of digital borders and having the cloud borders like airspace and land are actually that\'s going to be important and otherwise and that also relates to it\'s not simply a weapon but a person who\'s disaled with your population who\'s inside is something which uh that they\'re not a member of your social network your your community social network and then they can just go and blow something up for example right so um I think people are going to have a reconfiguration of what they think of in terms of like nationality in terms of their network membership for example so so picking that up and there\'s there\'s an old framing in thinking about any new technology that to begin with you force the new technology to fit what you already do and then over time you change how you work in order to fit the new technology you can think about how that\'s worked with email or the web or or e-commerce or even go back and think about cars for example and I thought it was interesting particularly given what what you just said and some of the stuff you talked about in the past that particularly with things like if we think about when the internet get deployed and then crypto and now with machine learning there\'s a sort of step one where you force it to fit your existing legal structures and then there\'s a step indeed Uber and then there\'s a step two where you say okay maybe if this doesn\'t fit our existing legal structures we change the legal structures or we take a step back and say well what is it that the law was trying to do and maybe the underlying aim can still be accomplished with this new thing but we changed the law to fit it and clearly we s we\'ve seen that around crypto in the last year or two in the US um and we\'re having a whole wave of questions now around machine learning um and I\'m kind of wondering how much we again um how many laws there are that we\'re going to change or how many places there are that the technology is going to change in order to fit the underlying aims of the laws i mean I think um so will when will the laws change when will the tech change i think um I mean you know the lessic thing of code is law right like I I think um you can think of the state and the network as two different layers where I do think the network moves faster and that things are de facto feasible digitally and then the law is then adapted to shape is is the network moves first and then the law comes second especially because for example in social media with AI you can literally write draft legislation post it and actually get it implemented and so this is becoming the governance layer like the actual parliament is social media in a sense right it\'s not really Congress like the debate is happening on social media right that\'s actually almost like the true voting system the voting is happening every day so I do think in many ways in the west it\'s network over state I think in China it\'s the opposite it\'s state over network they have um they have like a taken the opposite evolutionary branch and they just clamp down so hard that the network is within this firewall all the apps are contained all the cos are within a mile of you know like uh uh Beijing and so on and so forth so that\'s like the alternate scenario where the network is underneath the state versus the uh the western scenario yeah actually I think crypto is super interesting right now because we have in the United States an administration that is completely reversed the traditional stance it\'s not left or right it\'s just this anti-establishment position which is to introduce a Bitcoin reserve to legalize crypto and tokenization and I don\'t think people have really understood in the traditional political world what a revolution this is because what it really is on one level is creating pathways for bright people who get together to create value to not have to wait for Wall Street or Silicon Valley to bless them they will be able to tap sources of capital bypassing them but also this means the creation of an entrepreneurial class that\'s much larger than what we\'ve ever had and I\'m very impressed with the work that you\'re doing actually with your network uh creating this new generation of entrepreneurs um and as they do that they will not be joining big corporations and big corporations this also is like such a radical change if you create something on a smart contract let\'s say and you raise your capital by tokenizing it then you\'re never going to issue equities well if you never issue equities and let\'s say that\'s where the new Apples and the new Teslas are coming from what happens to the stock market answer it\'s going to go away and have we thought about a lot of our power structures are based on there\'s equity and there\'s debt and it\'s regulated by the government now we\'re going to have something new so I I I agree with some of that here\'s here\'s the parts I agree with uh I think um you\'re going to go from basically the current US financial system to an internet financial system and the fact that stable coins are now legal and we have an onchain dollar that maps to an off-chain dollar will mean we have onchain equities that map to offchain equities we have onchain fund interests that map to off-chain fund interests and basically every fiat paperbased form of anything in finance will be now be put on chain um because once the currency part is on chain there\'s no reason the rest of it isn\'t that means you get internet capital markets so I don\'t think that equity goes away i do think that it gets mixed with coins and tokens and basically the new Wall Street is onchain so that\'s one piece of it the other piece is I do agree with you that this is the century of the individual over the institutional in fact just even the 9 by6 the vertical format uh it\'s just maybe it\'s a coincidence maybe you know but to film on that you\'re filming an individual it\'s often like they\'re standing tall in the frame right whereas the traditional movie 16x9 is widescreen so it\'s a panorama it\'s an institutional it\'s a march or something like that so that itself sort of symbolizes that transition from this very you know giant organization centralized century of the 20th century to this individual lone kind of person or small group of the 21st Yeah there\'s a sort of um a forcing function you can see I was in Rome a couple of weeks ago and got up very early to walk past the Trevy Fountain and of course there were 300 would be influencers all there and they weren\'t auditioning or trying to get a meeting um in LA they were all effectively auditioning on Tik Tok or auditioning for the algorithm or trying to find their audience or trying to create something and you can kind of make fun of it but you also look you know this is media and pop culture become radically decentralized and today that\'s the Tik Tok algorithm the Instagram algorithm um the YouTube algorithm in the future those may be on chain they may not or probably some combination of the both of but it is a sort of radical decentralization of a kind that we kind of go through we\'ve gone through kind of every 50 years or every hundred years um we sort of reset how all of those those kind of cultural systems work um we\'ve got sort of five minutes left on the clock there\'s a kind of a classic quote I wanted to talk about from Robert Solo um who said that you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics um which is always this sort of funny paradox that like here we are most of us earning our living from glowing rectangles that didn\'t exist 30 years ago and doing jobs that didn\'t exist 30 years ago and yet um an economist will say well this is all great but I can\'t actually see it in the numbers um so on that I actually had a thread on this 5 years ago so where\'s where\'s the where\'s the internet and the productivity statistics so um by one measure like you know within living memory backspace didn\'t exist like people were writing on typewriters photocopers didn\'t exist right so you couldn\'t backspace you couldn\'t copy paste let alone search let alone pull all the links all the citations for something you know let alone use AI the tooling that we have now versus something people had in like the 70s or the 60s is so insanely amazing that you should be writing a novel a week or whatever in theory right of course you can now do it with AI slop but like a like a good one right and uh because you know the this the sheer speed the the resources available are so much greater you know and uh and yet is that the case and um I I have like five thesis that are you some of them are are there some of them are not one is uh there\'s a great divergence where some people are making use of all that stuff and those are the indistractable few that can just lock in and you know hit keys faster build a unicorn faster right and most people aren\'t like that but some some are and so that\'s why you see these crazy growth rates for things um a second possibility is the great distraction we\'ve given all this productivity but we\'ve also you know all the negative stuff all these crazy distracting social media things or whatever a third is uh there\'s been some dissipation where we have because of those tools we have bureaucratic forms that then arise to absorb the complexity somewhat different than distractions it\'s like oh you can write 20 pages okay I want 20 pages of documentation so the the form expands to become more complex and then you know maybe the answer is actually that all the stuff we\'re writing online maybe humans shouldn\'t have all these notion documents and word documents and so on maybe like it needs to be full stack robot for it to actually work maybe us generating all these documents and box folders and what have you is actually a waste of time because we still have to comprehend it to do something with it maybe you just want something to comprehend it and just act like this and and close the loop because the email is sent so much faster than a than a postal mail but our actions maybe it\'s the human in the loop that slows the whole thing down right then maybe you want that though maybe you want to slow the whole thing down maybe you want that deliberation or something so um I don\'t know i I I think it\'s some mix of these oh one thought is it\'s also the great divergence but the society level like there\'s certain things like ship building or uh or building houses that China is like 100 or a thousandx faster at like not not in a uh not in a figure of speech wave but literally like a thousandx faster at for example they have 200x ship building capacity of the US and so maybe the answer is the productivity is there just not being used in the west and it\'s there in other places so the these are some possible explanations i I had a joke on on Twitter a few years ago that like young people won\'t believe this but before Excel investment bankers worked really long hours and now thanks to Excel a Goldman Sachs associate gets their work done at lunchtime on Friday and goes home and of course that\'s not what happened well why is that not what happened um it used to be that you could do that analysis and it would take a week so you wouldn\'t do it and now you can do 50 different analyses and it will take you the afternoon so you do you demand 100 and they\'re there until 2 in the morning um has the productivity of that associate gone up depends how you value that analysis in the end you might still take the same investment and you might still get the same return but you had 5x more more analysts before you made that decision so maybe productivity\'s gone down um all of that in a sense is like people got very excited talking about the um um the what was the the paradox about coal um the um mass and no the you know the the um I know the one you\'re talking about where where when use when the cost of something goes down your usage goes up my mind\'s gone black it\'s all applied price elasticity if you make analysis cheaper if you make any of these tools cheaper does that mean the productivity goes up does it mean you just use the tool more I mean the big thing is what is productivity is paradox is it measured in like dollars per hour well I don\'t know maybe there\'s some fiat issue with depre you know devaluation that\'s measuring it if it\'s measured in terms of just like widgets like physical widgets produced well we\'ve got a lot more of those things so like in in the in the ratio scale sense we have a ton more phones drones all that kind of stuff than we did 20 30 years ago and so maybe maybe we\'re looking in the wrong place in terms of numbers i think that\'s it but personally as an economist I think we\'re measuring it wrong and it\'s this idea like the Federal Reserve has that when you buy an iPad that because the price came down and the capability of the iPad went up you got a productivity gain but the fact that the person who bought the iPad doesn\'t know how to use any of that productivity they\'re still using only 10% of what it\'s capable of means we\'re just measuring it all wrong and maybe one further thing is what we do with all our productivity gains is not take advantage of them we just keep working harder and as we keep working harder we\'re actually becoming less efficient because we\'re not taking advantage of what this has bought us which is time to do other things and I do think this is a big issue with AI now AI is going to free us up to not have to work so much and then people are like "Well what the heck am I going to do if I\'m not working?" And I\'m like "What about living what about being human what about spending time with your loved ones painting doing art?" And they\'re like "Well that\'s not productive." But that\'s the most productive thing you can do as a human being so I think this question of what constitutes productivity is now becoming a very profound human question okay I think that\'s that kind of call for emotion is a good place to end our analysis i think there\'s a red light flashing at us so thank you very much', 'text_length': 41550, 'word_count': 7818}, prompt_type='extract', model_used=None, tokens_used=None)
