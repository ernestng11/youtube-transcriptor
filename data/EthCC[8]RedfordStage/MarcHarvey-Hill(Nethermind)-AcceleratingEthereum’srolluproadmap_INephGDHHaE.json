    "aggregated_text": "uh hello my name is mark and i work as a core developer on ethereum at nevermind um and today i'm going to be talking about surge uh which is nethermind's based rollup template um and how it's accelerating ethereum's rollup road map um and a big thanks to david for the creating the original presentation this is based on and also to lynn for his feedback um so roll-ups are just fancy multi-igs they don't really inherit ethereum security roll-ups are still slow um so i think there's really some legitimacy in these claims if we look at the state of ethereum's roll-ups today um we don't really see these as um criticisms i guess but more as like a challenge so how can we actually create a rollup which is uh neutral uh which is trustless um and extremely performant and that's really what serge is all about um but before i get into surge i'm just going to give a quick background on kind of how rollups work today if you're not familiar um so essentially the high level idea is there's a limit to how much we can scale the throughput of the l1 um while keeping it decentralized um so the idea of the whole rollup road map is that we're going to do a lot of this computation offchain and then we're going to po post a compressed proof to the l1 along with the transaction data um and then that's all going to be verified on the layer one and also the data made available um and the way that most rollups work today is with a centralized sequencer um so essentially we just have one entity who's going to be responsible for collecting all of these users transactions um putting them in order and then ultimately posting a batch of transactions to ethereum l1 um and this works but it has several problems right so we have just one single point of failure um so if this centralized sequencer goes down it becomes very difficult to actually get your transaction on chain um and this is also a censorship vector so we just have one entity who's able to just emit your transactions or just prevent them getting on chain if they decide to uh which concentrates power with this one entity um and relies on the reputation of this organization company whoever is running the sequencer um i mean one caveat to mention here is um you can have forced inclusion mechanisms so this is a way where instead of going through the centralized sequencer you can just actually bypass that and post directly to the l1 uh but there's several kind of negative parts to this so it's going to take longer to go on chain uh you're going to pay more potentially and be exposed to toxic me um so really the solution to this is based rollups um so with based roll-ups is the idea the idea is we're essentially just getting rid of the l1 proposer oh sorry not the l1 proposer we're getting rid of the centralized sequencer and we're going to replace it with the ethereum l1 proposer that we already have um so instead of introducing new infrastructure like the centralized sequencer we're just going to reuse the kind of existing mev boost pipeline uh that we already have on ethereum um and kind of to kind of walk through how this would work like how your l2 transaction ends up on chain uh you're going to send it to a separate mele so to the l2 mempool where these transactions are going to be bundled by the l2 block builders and these l2 block builders are the same entities as the l1 searches um so then this essentially from here goes through the normal med boost pipeline so the l1 searches send the bundles to the block builder who sends it to the proposer and then it ends up on chain um and there's several advantages to this so uh we're going to inherit uh ethereum censorship resistance and and livveness guarantees and hopefully their security depending on a few other factors um we're not introducing any kind of additional infrastructure in this centralized sequencer and this results in just generally simplifying everything and making it a lot more cost-ffective um and just aligning everything with the base layer so we don't really introduce these outside incentives um and there's also kind of big uh improvements in terms of composability which i i'll speak about in a little bit um so with surge what we're really trying to build is a neutral rollup and and what do i mean by that so i would define a neutral rollup as something a rollup that is uh permissionless trustless censorship resistant open source um it's able to be operated and forked by anyone all while remaining performant and reliable and these are really what we're going for with surge um so surge is a a base rollup template and by template i kind of mean this isn't just kind of another rollup we're deploying but it's something that can be built on top of so it's kind of made to be redeployed built on top of by other people um it's stage two at launch um which i'll speak about in a bit but this means it has very strong livveness censorship resistance security guarantees um it's based as we've just been talking about um it uses only native eth so there's no kind of external uh token which is introduced and 100% of the base fee is burnt at the moment although this is subject to change on mainet deployment um and it has extremely high like gigas level performance um so how did we actually go about building surge um so surge is based on the tao althia stack which is the most uh mature battle tested base rollup stack at the moment uh but we've made several modifications so we've replaced the finality gadget um so now we have a two of three multi-rover uh system which i'll speak about in a bit we've replaced the bond token so instead of any taico tokens as i mentioned it's just pure eth um changed the fee split so as i say at the moment 100% of the base fee is being burnt uh we've replaced the execution client so it's no longer using rollup g but it's based on the nethermine client um and we've also added a lot of um extensive documentation as i say it's all about people being able to build on top of it um and stage two security what does that mean so uh if you're not familiar we have this website l2b uh which is about classifying different l2s by their uh security and trustlessness guarantees um so with serge we have a 45day exit window so that means if there's some kind of upgrade and you you don't like it you want to exit your funds you have plenty of time 45 days to actually exit your funds uh there are no emergency powers uh very limited governance so unlike some of the roll-ups that exist exist today where they have some kind of uh emergency back door where they could kind of sneak through some last minute upgrade um essentially we don't have any of this here so you don't actually have to trust us you don't really have to trust anyone um it's all kind of smart contracts and and as i say you can exit your funds with plenty of time um and yeah so there's no tokens external tokens uh introduced um and this just generally aligns the incentives a lot more with the base l1 um it doesn't kind of introduce outside incentives or kind of like uh specul uh speculation um and just generally removes any kind of uh the uh overhead of like governance distributing this token market making all of this stuff it's just makes it a lot simpler um and we have giga gas level performance so this means billions of gas throughput per per second uh which is possible thanks to the nethermine client which has been demonstrated to have this kind of gig gas per second throughput um and this is possible all thanks to a lot of uh crazy technical optimizations uh by my colleagues uh working on the nethermine client with me um so we have this two of three uh multi-prover security model um so what this means is um the kind of uh state transition or the the proofs of the state transition are going to require um two out of these three different proof systems to all agree so we're going to prove um in this te based system uh using sp1 and risk zero and we have like a modified uh ref kind of state transition function running inside this uh but what all this means is uh we kind of avoid having one uh single point of failure in the prover so you're not depending on one prover that could have a bug and kind of derail everything and this is really important especially for stage two where it's kind of locked in and you can't change stuff so you kind of want to have this uh higher level of fault tolerance where you trust that at least two of three of these systems are going to agree and give the correct answer um so what can you do with surge today you can check out the website surge.wtf to kind of learn more you can spin up your own kind of part of the test net if you want to try it out you can check out our docs or contribute on the github um or you can actually start playing around on the test net today uh you just need to uh get some hoodie from the faucet and bridge it over to surge um and we have kind of several improvements or power-ups in in the pipeline uh the most important of these is pre-confirmation so this is massively improving the kind of user experience of base rollups by giving pre-confirmations and we're aiming sort of on the latency of uh sort of less than two seconds so you're not going to have to wait for the full uh 12 second slot to get a confirmation of your transaction uh we're working on also improving the kind of security the proving ar uh architecture the block building um and also just improving this kind of uh composability which is a big uh benefit of base rollups um so yeah the the plan for what we're doing next is you continue innovating as i say this is not kind of built as a as a base roll up in itself it's more about this template that people can take and build on top of uh we're improving the prover a finality gadget we're going to release on mainnet um and yeah we really just want the community to kind of take over this project from us um and one example of this is ethereum r1 um so this is a project which was announced not too long ago um and this is a neutral rollup which is kind of built by the community um and it's planning to be built on on top of the surge stack um so this is funded 100% by donations i think the plan at the moment is to raise a,000 eth um and this as well as all of the uh fees raised are all going to just go to funding the development of of the of the chain itself and then after 2030 it will be burned and yeah it's just community governed there's no kind of external token or governance um and this is really the the ethos of surge um i want to just speak briefly on some of kind of how this uh base pre-confirmation system is going to work um so as i said we're aiming for pre-confirmations on the order of less than two seconds of latency um so the way this works is essentially a pre-confirmation is just a promise from from a future proposer that they're going to um include your transactions uh so what we need for this is that proposers are all going to hold some kind of stake and if they uh don't honor the pre-confirmation they gave so your transaction was pre-confed in the block then you can expect that someone is going to be slashed um and there's a few different ways this can be implemented so the proposer themselves can issue pre-confirmations if they're kind of a sophisticated actor so they have a high kind of bandwidth low latency connection and can kind of rapidly give out these pre-confirmations or it could be uh delegated to a pre-confirmation gateway or delegated to the builder through uh meb boost um and one requirement of this is eip7917 which i think is planning to be included in fusaka um which allows you to kind of look ahead and see who a future proposer is so you can see who's the next person i can get a a pre-mp from um and also i want to speak a bit about synchronous composability so this is really i'd say maybe the biggest benefit of base rollups um so we get this um instant atomic composability between base rollups and with the l1 um so by atomic i mean you can have one transaction which is going to like access or do stuff across all the state um and yeah it essentially allows for unified liquidity across all of these chains so between the base rollups and the l1 and essentially making it all feel like one chain again um so kind of to give a brief kind of uh idea of how this would work so to send a message from the l1 to the l2 uh you would submit a kind of message to a contract on the l1 and then the l2 builder or l1 searcher is going to actually inject this message into the l2 within the same slot um and then it's also possible to go the other way so have a message pass from the l2 back to the l1 um so this will be kind of trivial in future when we have real-time proving so you can kind of immediately prove what is the current state of the l2 um but it's actually possible today um through solvers so solvers can condition their solutions on um actually so they're going to create a batch of transactions and they condition that this batch is only going to be validly included if this um l2 to l1 withdrawal is going to happen and this is kind of like a nice workaround that we can use until we have real uh real-time proving and if you're interested in that we have um a couple of posts from uh some research at nethermind um which can give you a bit more information about that um and yeah i have one more slide here which is about kind of another project which we're working on at nevermind which is slightly separate but i think still related um so this is called way so this is um a project we have which is all about kind of automating core protocol development which is very much kind of in the spirit of accelerating the road map the idea here is to have kind of these autonomous agents which are helping to coordinate between uh different ethereum development channels like understand the eip process and just generally be able to connect everything so i think this is going to have kind of a big impact on accelerating both the l1 as well as the the rollup road map so i just wanted to kind of give that a quick mention uh but yeah so you can check everything out here and um yeah thank you very much for listening yeah any questions okay i guess not thank you",
