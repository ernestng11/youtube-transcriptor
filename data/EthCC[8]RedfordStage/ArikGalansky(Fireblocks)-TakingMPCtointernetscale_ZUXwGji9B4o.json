the VP of technology at Fireblocks Um and the first question is why do I talk about MPC so there's actually two reasons Uh the first one as Fireblocks obviously we're a very big uh provider using MPC wallets as part of our offering um passed trillions of dollars through our system over the last few years Uh so we've been doing a lot of production scale MPC uh and researched a lot of it published a few different protocols That's number reason number one Reason number two is because I'm not a cryptographer Uh and I think MPC and cryptography in general are too important to leave it to only cryptographers uh because once you introduce some of the architecture considerations there's a lot of things that come out of it and that's a lot of what this conversation is going to be about How architecture meets cryptography because we want to combine them into solutions Okay So we're going to go through a few chapters and in each one of them we'll close with a bit of a conclusion small one and continue to the next one The first one is ECDSA The question is why do we use ECDSA and the answer is because somebody patented Schnore Okay so Schnore is an amazing protocol super easy super fast hard to easy to MPC a lot of advantages but for 20 years it was patented And so when a lot of the systems that wanted to use this kind of a cryptography wanted to use they couldn't use it And so an alternative was developed I will not go into the details of this entire process but the alternative is not as nice in some places right it created some challenges but everybody adopted it because a patent and actually a strong patent can really take over this kind of a situation so we see ECDSA in blockchains like you know Bitcoin and Ethereum some of the newer blockchains adopted because it was after the patent um but we see it in iMessage internals we see it in Pasis most of pass is our ECDSA We see it in TLS certificates today Most of the websites you'll visit will use ECDSA for the digital certificate We see it in passports like and all of the digital identity stuff We see it in a lot of places and it's not going to change Okay So changing a technology like ECDSA is hard and ECDSA became the de facto alternative to RSA So if you didn't want to use RSA for all of the reason not to use RSA in your use case you went ECDSA And so now it's built into a lot of places Um there's a great lecture by Abishalot that you can uh look up that talks about why it's really hard to root out ECDSA from all of the systems it's inside Uh blockchain's included right if somebody wants to change those things it's really hard to get to the consensus unless we get to Busquantum And this is actually probably the first time that somebody will be able to change ECDSA to something else So it's a bit of like the you know the the BitMax the uh the cassette thing Um okay So great that's number one So ECDSA is here to stay Uh let's talk about MPC So MPC is actually quite a like a technology that has been used for quite some time now right it's invested invented in the 80s but really found its product market fit in blockchains Um in wallets specifically We'll talk a bit about this Uh but like now especially in our space people usually know what MC MPC means which is not the case in a lot of other places in a lot of other ecosystems Um there's a few way to categorize uh MPC So first way is MPC versus two PC So it's either multi-party or two-party which is important distinction Another distinction is honest majority versus maliciously secure right like do we go by the majority or do we actually like any single participant can know the protocol is secure by definition of them being secure And the last one is general purpose versus DSS DSS is very specific to digital signatures Um now why is it used in wallets okay why do people use MPC in wallets there is actually only three main reasons The first one is key theft We all know that a single point of failure is a problem when we have something important to secure MPC solves the single point of failure problem Now you have multiple shares You need to get all of them or some amount of them to actually get the key Much more secure No single point of failure That's number one Number two is self- custody Now obviously self- custody is more regulatory oriented But like if we think about the technology aspect of it we don't want the vendor to have the entire key because if the vendor has the entire key they can do whatever they want But we also don't want the client to necessarily have the entire key because if they're hacked they lose everything So there's like this control of the the vendor that we want limited MPC gives us that And there's the uh uh security of the user which the vendor can provide which MPC also gives that So those three things basically created a situation that MPC became a de facto standard in uh um blockchain wallet security in a lot of situations especially in the institutional space Great So we understand we have ECDSA we're kind of stuck with it We understand we have MPC solves a lot of problems Now let's talk about the combination So how do we measure an MPC protocol is good Okay So obviously like the first level is like the security of it I'm not going to go into the security footprint of MPC protocols I want to talk about efficiency and architecture So if we're talking about communication we have two parameters that we look at Number one is the number of rounds How many times MPC is a communicative interactive protocol How many times do we need to go back and forth in messaging to basically sign a message So that's number one Number two is how much each exchange like that how much data does it need to transfer Okay those are things you will usually see protocols uh disclose when they uh publish themselves So that's number one that's on the communication The second part is more on the scalability of the protocol itself How much compute do I need how much memory do I need and eventually and this is a new one Can I scale to multiple servers and this is part of what this basically this lecture is going to be talking about Okay so MPC for ECDSA is hard I mentioned earlier it's much easier to do it for shnore because the the basically the shnore signature itself is more NPC friendly So the first versions of Schnore had three rounds Uh the first versions of MPC on ECDSA had eight nine rounds Okay that's a lot of back and forth communication uh a lot of them were more like trying to be like the fast version the efficient version But eventually I think a lot of people as an ecosystem thought that MPC is slow Okay Uh because lots of round many seconds to sign a lot of overhead The good thing is that it's getting much much better Okay So a lot of brilliant people have been working on MPC protocols in the last few years and they've been shaving rounds away shaving uh computations away uh basically step by step uh uh protocol by protocol and so you can see here some of the protocols from the last few years You can see sometimes it's like two three rounds Four is like the most Uh you can see some of them have like very low computation but then a lot of times they'll have very high communication as a result of that And some have low communication but they might have high computation Um and so this is kind of getting much better but actually with the latest protocol we published uh we got to this result which is we think it's pretty meaningful and groundbreaking but not just because of how it measures I'll talk about how it meets architecture because I think that's going to be very interesting Okay so we finally got to the architecture part Um how do we see uh signing okay like very highlevel generic right we have a wallet They need you to sign something They send you a message Please sign this Then there's a protocol Now how long this protocol takes depends on what protocol you use But eventually now you need to create a signature in an interactive way between the two parties or multiple parties And eventually you produce a signature put it on the blockchain right high level architecture makes a lot of sense Now let's choose NPC categories for this right so like obviously we can do general purpose MPC because general purpose is general purpose It can do anything But TSS is more efficient for digital signatures Doesn't make sense to use general purpose NPC for a digital signature We'll use TSS because it's more efficient Great One choice made Second choice NPC or TPC So you can do MPC right if you want more parties But you look at the architecture we have here In this specific architecture we only have two parties So we can do two PC Now I will say a bit of a cheat TwoPPC protocols can have one virtual party that does another MPC within Not going to go into this We published a paper on it some time ago Uh but like you can get more parties involved if it's important for your security architecture but generally speaking TPC is good enough for this use case We're going to stick to 2PC Uh the last part is malicious security because there is no majority in a two out of two Okay so like the honest majority not useful here Uh so we're we're obviously going to go to for it to for uh malicious security also because as I mentioned we want to protect the parties We want to protect uh the client party from if they're hacked we want to make sure that basically like you know like oh you understand I think I think I covered it Okay great So this is the general architecture Let's talk about the two things we mentioned communication and scalability We're going to start with communication Rounds are expensive Okay now I know in the table above all of the numbers kind of look the same You have four here seven here What does it matter but rounds are very very expensive So a round and this is from a DKLS paper not our paper a DKLS paper from a few years ago They measured rounds between uh data centers in Google servers right so this is not even client This is not a guy in the desert that's connecting This is like a server of Google to a server of Google can take you 300 milliseconds in communication if they're uh a bit far away So now think about the fact this is what rounds mean for us maybe 60 milliseconds maybe 300 milliseconds that's a lot of time So rounds are really important Uh now rounds are also complicated When we think about rounds usually in architecture we're like okay if I send you a message it's a round If you send me a message that's a round or we might think about the combination So the thing is in cryptography there's two definition of around So around is either I send you a message or it's we send the message back and forth at the same time as long as they're not correlated Uh now which is very non-intuitive right so when you think about rounds if you say hey I have a two round protocol I might say oh so you send two messages Well no we actually send four Uh okay so like that's a bit confusing but remember it round are like they're complex uh there's like non-intuitive things here so again rounds are important now let's go back to architecture in architecture like in computer science there is no such thing two things happening at the same time uncorrelated like there's like some flow right we need to think architecture so like when we think about the architecture our architecture here we're trying I'm going to try to correlate it Okay I'm going to try to correlate it to the architecture we know from the internet Right when you think about how Dupasis work when you think about how web hooks work when you think about how push notifications in mobile devices work it's always the same way Server sends to the client a message hey I have something for you to do The client does something right maybe it's a manual process by a person Maybe it's an automated process Returns a message to the server Hey I've done the thing Here's the things I've done And then the servers continues like whatever possibly with some outcome So the architecture we're thinking about internet architecture as long as we can keep this architecture right and the important thing to keep the internet architecture is you see the green arrow We need our MPC protocol to basically be completed in one go one message Um but there is no MPC protocol that completes in one message So that's a problem But if we use a protocol that has two rounds and they're both unidirectional rounds so they're the nicer kind of round if you remember only one message we can actually pinpoint it into this architecture right because we have the first notification message So maybe we can put one of the rounds on that message from the server to the client And then we have the return message We can put the second round on that message Now we have a full MPC protocol running within internet architecture That's a very interesting thing that we can use in different ways But we need to make sure our MPC protocol is optimal round complexity means two unidirectional round Uh um yeah if we don't then suddenly we need to add more rounds Um and also we said like rounds are important for speed Okay So out of the list of protocols we defined earlier there's a few protocols that do have this optimal round complexity we talked about Uh uh so I marked them here So that's great because those are protocols we might be able to use in our architecture But I'm going to make it a bit harder because the first round I said we might be piggybacking on a notification and notifications architecturally might have limitations So for example if you send the push notification to the mobile device you don't have unlimited uh uh message sizes you're limited to four up to five kilobytes of a message depending on the vendor I don't remember iOS versus Android but they have like four to five message uh size limitation If you're using a QR code and there's a lot of use not a lot but there's some using QR codes especially when you want to transfer information to a colder device uh then you're limited to 3 kilobytes of a QR code Now again that's a limitation You it's an architectural limitation Uh so if you have a protocol that needs like a 100 kilobyte of a message and you're trying to push it on a QR code you need to show like uh like uh I don't know like 20 30 QR codes back and forth That's a problem right um so we actually optimally want less than 3 kilobyte per message Uh and that's what we achieve in our protocol So this is why we believe our protocol is groundbreaking in the ability to do architecture oriented things that we wanted on our path to internet scale MPC Now just to summarize this we measure protocols we usually measure them cryptographically we measure them as a paper when when those papers meet reality they meet the architectural limitations of the architecture that we run on In some situations it means that if you have too many rounds you're outside of the protocol and the architecture If you have too big messages you're outside of the protocol and the architecture We have to start adding more rounds to get data So those are definitely things we don't want when we talk about internet scale Great So let's talk about scalability MPC has been historically trying to be as efficient as possible on the machine right like uh basically least amount of memory least amount of compute uh least amount of communication but it all looks at things from the single machine uh perspective That's not enough If we want internet scale uh we need multiple machines We need infinite machine scale And so this is again I want to remind this is how internet scalability works How does internet scalability works in a very simple way I have many servers as a provider One of the servers sends a message to the client The client does their thing They go back to any other server Okay not the same server any other server This is how we do internet scalability Um and we want this in MPC And so this is a place where I want to introduce statelessness Okay So again if you've ever scaled internet systems you know you want stateless services right because you can scale stateless services It's hard to scale stateful services In the context of MPC we need to define what does stateless mean because we have a key Obviously you need the key So the way we define stateless is that if it's a result of the key generation it's storage It's not state If it's the result of the signing process it is state And what we want is an MPC protocol that does not have state that has a stateless signing process We can storage we can handle storage There's a lot of mechanisms to scale storage but state during the MPC process is actually hard Now I'll skip through this Okay So can we do stateless MPC easily uh there's two ways to easily try and do stateless MPC Number one we just add more servers Okay and we tell them hey there's this share database Make sure you check state on this database Number two we say you know what instead of having a database I'll just encrypt my information when I send it to you And when you go back to me I'll decrypt it so I know I have the same state So now I can use the client for the state transition So those are two great solution except they're all vulnerable uh to attacks and specifically non- street use attack And the way you kind of attack this is that we kind of want you to go through this door but you don't actually want to go through the door we created This is by the way the result of my dog this morning Um okay So what do what would a malicious party do i would start the round send you the notification If you're a malicious party what you might want to do is try to get me to sign two messages on different randomness on two different servers And by doing that if you can somehow do that you can extract the key by maliciously crafting your uh random randomness in the protocol Now that means that in order to protect from this my servers need to be in complete synchronization and complete synchronization is not scalable So that is that is the native solutions just don't work what does work stateless MPC if the MPC by definition is stateless or a different way if it's deterministic then we can actually scale an MPC protocol now there's a few protocols that we can do this on top of and we do this by combining two things the first thing is we have the kind of protocol we talked about two party two unidirectional uh rounds and so like the MPC protocols that fall within that template three that I'm familiar with There's the uh BAM protocol which we developed There's the BHLS protocol by Lindel uh and a few co-authors and there's the Frost protocols for ED ECDS for EDDDSA So all of those protocols have that round complexity that we're looking for Obviously they have different things in terms of messages uh size Uh the second thing we need is deterministic uh generation of randomness and that can actually be done by a new concept introduced recently called EVRFs Um again there's an EVRF in the BHLS paper They introduced it We have a new EVRF that we'll be publishing soon Um the EVRF what it does is actually make sure that the randomness created on the client side cannot be whatever they want They have to follow a specific process in the randomness creation that is still random but does not allow them to give to give different randomness to different servers which means that that that attack vector is mitigated Now we can actually put the MPC on many servers and we don't actually care which server you go to because you're going to get the same result regardless of which server you went to So this actually solves a security problem that prevented doing the scalable solution Uh and we think this actually allows you to scale this to uh internet scale because what you can do now you can do horizontal scalability If you have more clients just add more servers That has not been the case in MPC protocols You could not just add servers Now you can just add more servers for scalability for high availability or for disaster recovery Um and those are the components that allow you for internet scale MPC And obviously there's a lot of different places where this can be used We believe that MPC is going everywhere every single device It will take a bit of time but we'll have MPC running across the internet for a lot of use cases not just for blockchain signing but obviously also for blockchain signing Thank you very much which obviously a lot of co-authors a lot of people involved in this research and a lot of people doing the previous reaches were built upon Uh uh so thank you very much",
