uh um uh inside uh polygon and well zisk is a ckvm very much like we just write programs in ras or circuits in ras and then we want to prove it that's very much what zisk is about okay so it's a program that as i was mentioned it was started started in polygon about one year ago we mainly took all the knowledge and all the technology that we had in the polygon zkbm what was very much the hermes team a long time uh we have been improving a lot during the these two years and we took all these we start building this zkbm and actually we start building zisk okay and uh the thing is that 15 days ago we just spin off uh from polygon and we are kind of a free project own project we are an open source project kind of a community project and we want to keep developing this technology why we spin from polygon maybe you can ask and there is a i mean there is a good motivation for that in one side uh i mean polygon is focusing more in the aggregation layer and in more higher level protocols and they want to be free to choose the best uh zk technology that's in the market okay and in the other side we are i mean uh we don't want to have a single customer i think the technology is much better just to be used in a full thinking place i think that this technology can be used anybody should be able to use even if it's a competitor of polygon or some someone else okay so we just spin off we just take i mean just take the team and yeah i mean we are outside we are getting in a startup mode we're having a lot of fun and this is what we are uh what we are what we are doing mainly we just take uh well this is more the details but mainly we just take all the ip we just take all the knowledge and we just uh continue continue the project and trying to be uh reference uh zk prover uh for the space because we need it a lot okay so you can actually you can follow us here i will put that the same slide at the end of the presentation okay um but what's the differentiation i mean why uh what's the what's this good at okay so well the first thing is that we from the first day we want to minimize the latency okay until now in the in the zkvm for example we well at the beginning was just trying to proof that was a big achievement but then we tried to um minimize the cost of generating the proof but we realized that we need in the in the modern protocols in the future every time we need more uh to low the latency so uh in zisk we took this as a requirement from the first day and we rebuilt everything in order to be able to prove as fast as possible and we are trying to push the technology as hard as we can so we can generate proofs in real time as we are going to show in this presentation but even further than that okay um why proving in real time is important actually i mean whatever you are going to do in the space you are going to need this i mean you are going to need this if you are a layer two and you want to build a roll up you are going to need uh you are going to need to build uh some circuit that proves the transition in the layer 2s if you're trying to communicate between chains and i'm saying l1 to l1 l1 to l2 l2 to l1 or whatever combination you want to do you want to prove i mean the aggregation layer for example so this is the big motivation why we started the project you need to uh you need the chains in order to communicate to other chains you need mainly two things one is to commit to the current state but the other is to prove that this state is valid you can do that by following the chain but if you have thousands of chains that all the chains follow the other chains this is not practical so the idea is that the chain uh proof that this state is valid so that the other chains just can take this proof and and and and verify that okay so if you are communicating between chains this is one this is important but again and the and the other part is for layer ones and layer ones i mean we see for example in the ethereum be chain i mean they call it somehow the zk consensus uh zk consensus and this is you used in many many many uh many place and can be very useful for scaling uh for scaling uh l1 another thing to mention for example in the like clients i mean if you want to prove the full chain and verify it in a mobile phone this is an important technology and for that you need to prove it in real time so i'm sure that in few uh i mean a few months or years or whatever we are going to see that all the blocks include some sort of uh zk proof in the in the in the consensus so that's why it's important and that's why uh this project makes sense and that's why we want this pro to push this project and and and pushing hard in this technology properties of this project well um as i mentioned is designed for for for uh to be i mean to be to be for fast latency and that means that it can paralyze a lot with multiple servers not in a single server but in a cluster of uh uh of servers it's a full stack i mean we built everything from a scratch we have all the pieces in in in host it's a 128 security i'm going to uh highlight that later we are fully open source i'm going to highlight that also later it's a risk five uh it's a 64 bits is i think it's the only currently i don't know if there is other projects but currently the only of this kind of these 64 bits this is interesting because for example if you want to prove uh programs running in golang or in c then uh uh you will need these uh 64 bits also is slightly more performance at 32 bits especially for memory transfers and uh other things and again it's um uh this technology is um i mean it's not only for proving a vm i mean it's just a full uh prover okay we will see we will see that in the in the stack okay but i want to highlight these two things the first 128 security i mean we are seeing in the space that we are start seeing oh 100 bit security a lot of projects are doing 100 bit security i mean this is not a pizza this is not a pizza uh option this is a must and maybe it's a personal thing here but i mean security what we are selling is security and we cannot low this i mean we could have spent in our team we could have spent maybe i don't know two weeks one month in doing 100 bit security but i'm we are not going to do it security is important 128 bits is important and i'm calling from here that uh all the teams should go i mean if we want to compare we need to compare with the standard 100 128 bit security if we decide 100 bit security then let's lower all the security of all the let's change the signature schemas to 100 to 100 bit security or the hash functions to 100 bit security but this is an important thing and this is uh something that we are committed in our team to keep the security as high keeping the high standards that we have in the ethereum community the second is open source i mean i don't want that in order to build a block on ethereum you need to pay some kind of royalty to some private company this is not acceptable we need to be open source i mean all the code that needs to be in the space needs to be open source need to be available and needs to be needs to be free to use that's why also we are committed uh to this i putting these two things big because i think these are two commitments that are important that uh in the space we need to take in a go as i mentioned um this is i mean we have the vm is one piece but actually we have a full proof a whole full prover full cpk prover that's built on top of that actually in this prover we have a build two language i mean it's an extension of the pill language that we built in the cvm this is all getting all all the improvements and all the knowledge that we get from there actually to build uh the new system the new modern uh proving system we have also the recursor that allows us to uh join uh many proofs generated with the proofman we allows us to join many proofs uh uh and i mean to aggregate these different roots okay but this is a full ecosystem um thing on any zk prover okay not only the the zisk vm which is actually the one that we are selling and what we are showing today okay but this a full stack from bottom to the from bottom to the top the main difference between p two and p one or if you wonder the main the main difference i mean the thing is that actually instead of having a single monolithic proof what we do is uh actually we divide the the proof in proofs you want or super pairs or many years that you want okay so and the idea is that in each proof you can decide how many you want i mean if you have a proof that has a lot of binary operations then you can add more if you have a longer proof then maybe in the main processor you will have more chunks of the main processor okay so you end if you have a lot of ketchup maybe you have a lot of ketchups okay and you have different pieces and then the idea is that we aggregate all of them with in a recursive in a recursive way okay so this is very much the structure on that and all that is written in pl2 and with all the language you can read it very very well okay um well this is a pl2 language that that mean all these state machines they communicate what we call it in to the bus so the idea of this bus is that um when one uh state machine maybe the the one processor instead of proving everything in one single machine actually there is one machine maybe the processor that's assuming that maybe a multiplication is valid or that the ketchup is valid okay and what's assuming this is added to the bus okay and maybe in in another co-processor in another state machine what's doing is actually proving this actual multiplication or this ketchup or this operation and actually subtracting from the bus is that the bus whatever you do in the bus you substract it in the bus okay um ector and i did a presentation before that they give all the details how how this uh mechanism uh work okay but this idea of the boss i mean at the end of the day whatever is assume it in one side needs to be prove it in the other side okay so that's why everything needs to zoom to zero okay but this is very good for example uh for doing some operations i mean uh some some u interesting things like that for example you have a multiplications okay so you have 64 bits multiplications 32-bits multiplications and uh maybe multiplications that are uh let's say common uh multiplications okay so you can have with this system it allows you to the processor assumes one multiplication and if it's a 32-bit multiplication you are using one state machine that actually is the one that's subtracting if it's a 64bit multiplication another one but if it's a maybe a one times one or something that's a common operation operation that happens a lot of time especially with a small numbers then you can prove it with a much cheaper uh uh operation um memory so the memories for example the memory the memory is a 64-bits memory and it's aligned by default okay and most of operations they are just memory just uh answers the so this is assuming some memory operation the memor operation happens for the another line actually what we have is a specialized uh state machine that's doing kind of the conversion i mean it's okay it's proving so proving this uh read that's not this align non-aligned bit but and actually it's pro it's um creating it's assuming two alignet uh systems okay and this is happens not many times in the in the command but you can solve it in a very elegant way like that okay the boss is also for example for the continuations i mean the idea is that how we connect uh one chunk of the processor with the other well the idea is that at the end of a chunk we save uh we save we add uh this state to the bus and at the beginning of the next processor we subtract it from the bus this is what allows us to connect the things the same thing happens with memory but instead of being chunks temporary chunks we have for memory addresses okay but at the end is a state i mean the memory we need to sort all the accesses to the memory by address and and by count i mean by by by step and the idea is that okay maybe we have one chunk of memory in one one chunk of memory in one the next chunk of memory mean so next page next page different pages on the memory and the idea is that we just have a kind of a state transition uh between uh one page and the next page but the idea is the i mean it's it's a special u continuation but data is exactly the same and we can use exactly the same the same bus okay another interesting thing is the uh another interesting thing i don't know how much i'm in time but u another interesting thing is the the what we call the inter continuations i mean because we have a lot of them you see most of the most of the state machines are quite i i feel it okay so we only have let's say wasted space in the last like in the last chunk but as an example for example in the the current block for example we have like about 100 um 100 chunks of the main processor and i mean all of them are filleted it's only the last one that maybe it's um not fully filleted okay so that's and our system allows us to build quite a big proofs especially if you are using clusters on that so the the the i mean the efficiency of uh the efficiency of the usage of the cells that we are using memory in memory is quite efficient but even that for example and u if if if we decide to go with let's say with a smaller machines or we you have we have a bigger proof then the idea is okay maybe we have a lot and we still have this uh we we may have this uh wasted uh thing okay but then we can do tricks that are interesting i mean we can the idea is we can have like connected we call it these auto continuations but the idea is that all of them are filled but here it may be some something that okay some something that we haven't proved yet or maybe we are proving ahead in here so there are some operations that maybe are from the next one that we already proving here or the other way around but there is still some operations that maybe we are not proving here they are uh pending to prove here and we pass to the next one so the idea is that at the end uh we are filling even all the blocks even with other with other continuations so this problem of rounding things is not uh a big uh problem for us of course at the end the i mean what's spending to prove at the end the bus needs to be needs to be zero okay so this is the simplified version of this okay we are already i mean we are integrating with froof i think we are running in the stage i don't know if today tomorrow maybe this next this week or next week uh whenever it is we are going to be uh there i hope that very soon and this is the slide that i want to mention because i think this is the new one and this the the big announcement that we are doing here in ecc okay and this actually we are proving uh blocks in real time for to show this we are taking a block that's i mean it's a quite costly block i mean it's a block that's let's say in the five top percent of the blocks i mean it's really expensive there is only 5% of the blocks that are more expensive than that so it's a high rate uh block okay and here you see the number of gpus that we are using i mean when we if we are using just four gpus this takes about 90 seconds but if we are using uh 64 uh gpus we are already below the the 12 seconds okay there is still here are some some things to improve and uh i believe that i'm going maybe to the next stage okay this is the the the targets that we are we believe to use and we believe that if not all most of the blocks of ethereum they should be able to be proof in um should be able to be proved in uh uh 12 seconds okay uh this is the timings that we are getting you see that aggregation is really really fast and there is a lot of margin to do that the winner computation this is the one that we are working we already did a lot of improvements the last weeks but this is a still margin to improve there here in the in the in the gpus we have some balancing things that can be improved but these are the numbers that i think that the coming weeks we can easily achieve and again in working with 32 gpus this should be more than enough for proving uh whole blocks still a lot of work to do but uh a lot of optimizations to do and a lot of things in the backlog to do but we are already there of course this is needs to be uh audited needs to be uh uh in order to be production ready it's still some some work to do but we are quite excited and uh we are in the i mean progress uh to do that so that's very much my presentation again you can follow us uh here and thank you very much for your time i don't know if i have one one for one question have one time for one question maybe okay just thank you very much for the talk my question is about how do you um guarantee coherencies between these subcircuits that you are computing in parallel how do you make sure the input that was passed each one of those subp parts matches exactly yeah the the the the idea is this is this is um well let me just go back but this is the the so the idea is that aggregation the aggregation circuit so all this is guaranteed that mean this this is when this aggregated this is is a kind of a tree okay a tree of uh of proof okay so this input are inside so are passed to the to the to the to the top circuit and are propagated uh to all the circuits okay so all the inputs are known for all the all the inputs are known for all the circuits okay so and and because we are aggregating them we are sharing that we guarantee that all of them they have exactly the same the same inputs got it yep that's it okay but thank you very much and any question i'm outside",
