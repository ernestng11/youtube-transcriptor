Agentic AI i'm your host Thomas Maybreer and I'm the digital media producer for Valerie valerie is one of the core contributors to OLS and if you haven't heard of us or you haven't heard of Agents Unleash let me quickly take a moment to tell you a little bit about both so Ols is the best way for anyone to own and monetize their AI agent that includes people just like you you can learn more about how to do that at ol.network and agents unleash isn't just a podcast it's also the premier event series for people interested in AI agents events have been held all over the world with over 77 speakers and presenters and more than 2500 inerson attendees the next Agents Unleashed event has recently been announced it'll be held June 30th in Ken in France rsvps are currently open you can learn more about how to secure your ticket watch recordings of previous talks at ol.network/agents- network/agents-unleashed or check out the show notes for the link to just grab a ticket today i would say you should definitely do that now because previous events have been jam-packed okay so on today's episode I want to share two very interesting developments from the world of Agentic AI the first of them is a state-of-the-art text to video plus audio model from Google called V3 i'm sure you may have already heard of it and the other is a brand new open source framework for building autonomous AI agents there's a lot to cover with both of these so let's get right into it so if you've been on social media at all this week I'm sure you've seen these viral clips generated by Google's new VO3 text to video to audio model it does some really incredible stuff and that's why it's made such a splash what this model can do puts it head and shoulders above its competition and the results especially when combined with other tools are really impressive now if we rewind back to about a year ago you will probably remember that OpenAI debuted their texttovideo model Sora with some incredibly impressive clips like this one i must have watched this particular clip like 10 times looking for some kind of tell that it was AI generated and it was extremely difficult however it was a long time before this model got into the hands of us end users that actually happened at around the end of last year for those of us in Europe I think it was a little bit later than that but I've actually been using Sora recently and I would say that it's a very good model sometimes it is yeah a little difficult to get knockout results like those in the demo but it's still a really powerful model that at the time really pushed the whole space forward and I think for many people was the moment where they really started to pay attention to this kind of model and what it's capable of like I said Sora is a really powerful model but it does one thing it takes text and turns it into video it can also do images but that's pretty much it v3 on the other hand is different in some very important ways not only do the videos look better than pretty much anything we've seen before even from other really strong contenders like Runway ML Cling Luma it has some really innovative features like its ability to generate synchronized sound audio and sound effects at the same time it generates the video it's an incredibly capable model and when it does things well the results are very impressive i'm going to put some of the clips up on screen while we're talking so you can see what it's capable of as I think is obvious from these clips VO3 is a state-of-the-art model i think it's probably the most advanced model of its kind particularly in terms of the quality of the generation and like I said this multimodal capability of producing synchronized audio and sound effects at the same time the video is generated literally no one else has been doing it like this before and yeah the results are very impressive google also offers V3 inside of their flow tool which is designed for generative film making it offers some controls around tweaking the generations the framing tone transitions that sort of thing for what it's worth Sora does also offer some of these film making type tools and I believe Runway does as well i can tell you from experience that Sora has some options that allow you to make changes like the ability to connect clips and transitions and a storyboard feature it's a little bit more like a non-destructive editor for film or video like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro than the straightforward oneshot generation that you may be used to if you've asked any of the larger LLMs for images for example ChatGpt or Grock so V3 is not free it's available through a Google AI Ultra subscription and I believe the absolute lowest price you're going to pay for that is about $250 a month with that subscription you're getting access to VO3 but also some other tools like Flow and access to Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think Mode another thing worth mentioning is that generating videos on V3 comes with a usagebased charge system you get some credits for free but if you want to go above those credits you do pay for them to generate an 8-second video is going to run you about $3 US depending on the features and settings that you choose to use so there's two really interesting things about this model that I want to talk about today one is the pace of innovation that it represents it's worth pointing out that we're only 2 years away from the viral Will Smith eating spaghetti video that I'm sure you've seen this is the original clip that went viral about 2 years ago and a comparison of an updated version generated by V3 there's only two years between these clips the difference is obviously huge these models are gaining capabilities and functionality at a really impressive rate by the way if you're listening to the audio version of the show you're not going to be able to see these so I would encourage you to check out the episode on X or YouTube or Spotify if you want to watch the video and you can see these examples that I'm putting up on screen so like I said before the pace of innovation we're seeing the really big players in AI make really quick advancements and what I think that means is that the open- source alternatives can't be far behind because that's another trend that we've seen recently when the big players bring out these state-of-the-art models with their super impressive results we've been seeing open source solutions come in right on their heels with the theme of the show i think that's obviously something that I and presumably you are excited by so whether the models are open or closed source the ability to create media like this with AI is going to have some consequences both positive and negative it's obviously very difficult to predict when where and the degree to which we will see these effects but we can talk about a few of them now and get ourselves thinking about them so right now as I mentioned before V3 is not cheap the subscription cost is high the generations cost money but I think with economies of scale we can expect to see that price go down probably significantly over the next couple of years knock-on effects from models like this well we're probably going to see them in film television advertising and also this growing field of generative AI that's created specifically for social media now that last part whether that's good or not is definitely up for debate but we're definitely going to see big changes in these spaces and in the future of work more broadly which is a theme that we've returned to often in past episodes of the show there's also questions about democratization and accessibility as I mentioned a few times VO3 is gated behind a relatively high payw wall in addition to the cost there's also going to be restrictions around geography for example if you're in a sanctioned country you're not going to have access to the payment methods required to pay for these things maybe even not have access to the model itself there's also going to be safety features built into these models where it's going to refuse to generate certain things decentralized and open- source solutions are going to be an essential counterbalance to these restrictions so that's one area of development I'm going to be watching very closely verifiability and authenticity are also somewhat threatened by this ultra realistic media creation that's possible with tools like this i think we can expect to see some cultural norms shift as a result of tools like this especially when it comes to talking and thinking about what we see and hear online and in other spaces as well in a sense tools like this could have a devaluing effect on certain creative formats like film short form video but there's also the authenticity premium that I think is already emerging this is the idea that as AI generated media proliferates people will seek out experiences that feel more authentically human to them whether that's knowing that a piece of film or media was made completely without the use of generative AI or experiences that prioritize real life in-person humanto human connection this is all very complex and it's definitely worth considering especially right now in these early stages how end users consumers like you and I can find a way to have a stake of both sides of this emerging market whatever direction this goes in this is definitely a very interesting and exciting time to be using AI tools that is for sure all right moving on so if V3 represents the centralized paradigm for access to AI tools here's a dispatch from the other side first some background so Intelligent Internet is an organization that envisions a decentralized user- centric digital ecosystem where AI agents can operate transparently and collaboratively they recently announced their II agent which is an open-source intelligent AI agent framework it's designed to provide AI assistance as productivity tools across a variety of domains it's basically an agentic framework for anthropics cla so the framework supports a wide range of use cases like research fact-checking content generation data analysis software development problem solving so on they say that the workflow is built to be both flexible and powerful and their results on benchmarks definitely speak for themselves it got some great scores on the Gaia benchmark which is a way of evaluating how well AI agents perform at certain solutionsoriented tasks the II agent demonstrated strong performance particularly in tasks that required complex reasoning tool use multi-step planning i'll put a graphic of those benchmarks up on screen here so you can check it out the II agent is the purple line in this graph so what's especially exciting about this project is that it represents another open-source alternative in a space that is rapidly centralizing that is to say AI agent frameworks for building assistance intelligent AI agent assistants they're not ubiquitous yet but are likely in my opinion to be one of the first areas where we do see agentic AI reaching mass adoption especially if the centralized players really get it right that's why it's really important that we have open- source frameworks and alternatives like II agent that give the public and developers more options to choose from being open source also means that the project can grow organically developers can build on top of it create new extensions new functionality maybe even fork it and ideally this would spark a virtuous cycle where the framework continues to evolve through the contributions of the community in terms of architecture and features the II agent has most of what you would expect from an LLM agent framework it can run code handle multiple modalities like PDF audio and images slides are one example that the co-founder Emad mentions in his intro video the framework also has a way to manage the history of your interactions with the model this is important for what's called context management when you have really long interactions or you're generating long outputs this helps the model stay on track and give you the results that you're looking for the agent does have a browserbased front end but for the more technical among you it's also possible to interact with it from the command line so I know that's going to be quite relevant to a lot of the developers in the audience personally I'm really excited to see how this project develops i think it's a major win for open source AI in general and it fits nicely with the vision of agentic AI ownership that OLAs puts forth to give you some examples of what I mean by that so an agent built with II agent could be a user of the OLAS mech marketplace which is a decentralized marketplace where agents can offer and sell services to each other you could use the mech marketplace to expand the functionality of your II agent-based agent or alternatively your agent could be providing its tools to other agents through the marketplace you could also bring an II agent into the OLAS ecosystem through the OLS SDK which would give you access to the protocols features like proof of active agent staking which helps you to incentivize people to run your agent you might even be eligible for developer rewards depending on what your agent does and how you register it on the protocol another possible pathway would be through the OS accelerator program which is a tiered program for teams that want to bring an AI agent to Pearl the agent app store application that makes it super simple for users to run and own different kinds of AI agents as of today May 29th the accelerator is almost full but if you want to put yourself in the running for up to $100,000 of funding to bring your AI agent to life you can check out details about how to do that in the description box or show notes so in my view the expansion of open source frameworks for building agents like this is incredibly bullish for the future of Agentic AI and the OLAs ecosystem more broadly if you've tried IA agent you've built something with it I would love to hear from you what have you created with it what does it do yeah get in touch i personally would love to hear about it okay so once again we've covered a lot of grounds so we'll wrap up episode 7 of the show here from my perspective it's clear that Aentic AI is not slowing down anytime soon so this is the best possible time for you to get familiar with these tools learn how to use them and also start thinking about how you could have a stake in the agentic AI of the future so if this episode sparked any ideas in you if you got any questions or comments for me please reach out i am Thomas Maybryer on X I'd love to hear from you as always you can find links to everything that we talked about in the description box or the show notes and don't forget to RSVP for the Agents Unleash event in Ken it's on June 30th so it's right around the corner before we go I want to make sure I remind you hey subscribe to the show and if you like this episode leave a comment a thumbs up and if you have any friends colleagues co-workers who you think should hear the show definitely send them a link to this episode we'd love to have them on board all right we'll leave it here thank you for listening this has been the Agents Unleash podcast and I'll see you next time",
