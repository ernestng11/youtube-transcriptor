Thomas Maybreer and I'm the digital media producer for Valerie one of the core contributors to Olas who sponsor the show if you haven't heard of Ols or you haven't heard of Agents Unleash let me quickly take a moment to tell you a little bit about both so Ols is the best way for anyone to own and monetize their AI agent and that includes people just like you you can learn more about how to do that at olos.network and Agents Unleash isn't just a podcast it's also the premier event series for people interested in Agenti events have been held all over the world with over 77 speakers and presenters and more than 2500 in-person attendees the next event will be held June 30th in Ken in France and it's free to attend but RSVPs are limited so definitely grab one while you can you can learn more about the event including how to secure a ticket at ol.network/agents-unleashed network/ aents-unleashed or check out the description box on YouTube or the show notes wherever you listen so on today's show I'm joined by Trent McConna co-founder of Ocean Protocol and the ASI Alliance in this conversation we talk about what it means for an AI agent to be truly autonomous why blockchains are key to their sovereignty and where brain computer interfaces could take us as the world moves towards artificial super intelligence this conversation definitely goes deep on AI crypto and the future of the human mind i found it really interesting and I'm sure you will as well so without any further ado here's my conversation with Trent McConna yeah Trent it's great to have you on the show maybe you can introduce yourself uh tell my audience like a little bit about your background and who you are uh sure hi so I'm Trent McConnie i co-founded Ocean Protocol and ASI Alliance quick background i was raised on a pig and grain farm in the in the middle of Canada very cold in the winters playing hockey but also you know driving tractors and grain trucks and shoveling pigmanir and all of these things and also you know interestingly my my father the farmer brought me and my brother's computer when I was very young programming from a very young age actually which in retrospect a wonderful gift that you know definitely influenced my career in life trained as an electrical engineer and computer scientist in undergrad um and then even during undergrad actually I I really got into AI a hacking AI tag for fun this was then in the mid '90s and that led me to a couple uh summer jobs working for National Defense Canada where I was working on raider defense systems uh doing AI classification and so on this was in the the mid late 90s as well so and I couldn't believe how lucky I was you know it was near impossible to find a job in AI back then but I managed to get one and but I was already obsessed with AI i was reading you know AA transactions on you know neural networks for breakfast in my dorm and stuff so that was sort of me being a big nerd obsessed with AI from quite a young age too uh anyway from that I started a company straight out of undergrad doing AI for chip design me and five other co-founders also from the same university uh University of Saskatchewan Canada and we uh you know this was the height of the.com boom in 1999 so uh we had cool tech it was you know deep tech we had solved some interesting problems um pretty compelling so we were able to raise money from uh Intel Synopsis and some others and you know built up the company and uh had it acquired five years later uh so that was a nice feather in my hat you know for early in my career and we were pretty proud of the tech that we built too from that I simultaneously started two things a second company also in the same industry it's EDA electronic design automation that's the industry where it's CAD switcher for chip design right that was the first company that was the second company the first one focused on design side the second one on verification you know once you have a design is it going to work as advertised right and both of them focused on analog circuits which are much hairier than digital you can't get away with these you know boolean abstractions um and my PhD was also in the same realm of you know analog EDA analog computerated design and the the unifying thread of all of that was you know using AI tools that had never been used in this industry before in the ways that we were using them it's pretty rare in general in that industry and found ways to do things like you know verify a memory uh chip in 10 minutes on a laptop instead of a month on a cluster of a thousand machines and you can imagine that's very useful to people designing memory chips so that was my career right up till 2013 2014 so um 15 nearly 20 years and I'm pretty proud of the time I spent there the second company got acquired too all that and then as the se second company was getting really strong not quite acquired yet um I being a big nerd I follow AR and VR and brain computer interfaces and of course when Bitcoin came came along um I was highly interested in that friends of mine and I would hang out all the time talking about it and then um by 2013 had learned about uh blockchain and would nerd about out about that as well in uh I think April or May of 2013 my wife and I were hanging out she's a trained um um she's you know assistant curated at the Louver and and other things so really you know world class in terms of um the art world and so we she had taught me about the problem how do you collect digital art and she had heard me talk her ear off about Bitcoin and blockchain and all this so we simultaneously asked the question together what if you could own digital art the way that you own a Bitcoin that turned out to be a great question to ask and so that was in early 2013 and that that led us to building something called a scribe basically an NFT platform you know uh that we uh built throughout 2013 and 2014 and officially launched well we did the beta launch in late 2014 and the official public launch in early 2015 um and that went well you know working with digital artists basically NFTs on Bitcoin and uh but we were too early you know this audience might know that NFTs themselves took off circa 2021 um by a lot of people who actually had got crypto rich so for us it was actually really tough to um turn this into a real business so while we had had some seed funding it was tough to do a series A so we went through a pivot briefly were we were doing a decentralized database wrapping MongoDB with BFT but basically decentralized database and uh that was really tuned to enterprise enterprises weren't really ready for blockchain yet either so we quickly did another pivot um going back to my roots saying realizing that blockchain can help AI a lot there's a lot of interesting sub problems in the world of AI that blockchain could make a big difference and one of the biggest ones was how do you get your hands on enough data to train your models right it it was already widely recognized that data is unreasonably effective in making your model accurate you know Google has a famous paper on that from the mid-200s and we we got this too so we said well let's use incentives blockchain style incentives to get help people get more data and then to tune in on that more let's build a data exchange a decentralized data exchange where there's no middleman that can you know see the data and otherwise keep it privacy preserving all that so uh we we developed those ideas starting in late 2016 and throughout 2017 and in fall of 2017 we officially announced it as Ocean Protocol and so we you know in the years that followed we built Ocean Protocol uh we had by 2020 we had built everything we said we were going to build you know built a decentralized data market and then layered on incentives around this and got pretty decent volumes um you know I think within a couple months of launch we done probably $50 million of volume on the decentralized data exchange that said it wasn't really blowing up in the way that we had hoped really taking off the way that decentralized exchanges worked for you know just crypto funding and all that sorry crypto trading so we said okay well we've built everything we said we're going to now let's leverage this infrastructure and explore applications on top since about 2021 that's actually been what Ocean Protocol has been doing um we have three sub teams within Ocean Protocol exploring various applications um from you know crowdsourced time series prediction um initially that's our predictor product ASI predictor um and where the initial focus is really um bitcoin uh predicting token prices right because that's something that can be self- sustaining um and so we launched that uh a couple years ago now and it's done a lot of volume over the time something like $3 billion volume so we're pretty happy with that but that's volume on the prediction side and the predictions are pretty good you know 52 56% um predicting uh Bitcoin ETH etc token prices and with that you can make okay money trading but the trading fees get in the way so you um you kind of break even but from that we've actually found ways to tune our strategy even more and things are going pretty well on the trading side now making money trading and so on that's one example uh we also worked on other applications things like uh decentralized exchange for music data the European government has something called Gaia X which is sort of a a European level data sharing protocol with different subsets for for automotive industry and for financial industry agricultural and so on so we've been quite involved with that from the get-go actually many engagements there with dozens of enterprises this is another sort of branch of ocean if you will and more applications right um we're actually even starting to get into some brain computer interface stuff in the last 6 months so that's really what ocean is about you know we have this baseline foundation of decentralized data exchange and to do that well you actually need decentralized access control think of it like permissioning right and we also leverage a bunch of privacy preserving technologies so that people can keep their data private uh you know we use in various places trusted execution environments working closely with Oasis on that one we use you know encryption and decryption hashing all that you know the standard tools of crypto but then also in various places we we've worked with MPC and zero knowledge proofs and many other things as needed and actually Ocean also has a homegrown technology we call compute to data and basically it makes it easy where you can serve up your data selling it with you know decentralized handshaking where the other person they never ever see the data instead they submit scripts to you like say Python script to analyze the data and then they get to see the results and you you vet the script because what if it's just you know copy the data so you vet the script but then they are buying the results so for example I could have my DNA data that I don't want to leave my my servers at all but maybe someone wants to count the number of A's and T's in that or do some other analytics on it or build a fancier model or something right so this is the sort of thing that uh Ocean supports very nicely and it's all decentralized handshaking of course so yeah that's what ocean's about you know decentralized data exchange infrastructure and these days of course it's also nicely it plays well with agents right humans don't have to be the user autonomous agents can be as well and I guess one final thing you know about a year ago um we've had the Ocean token out since about 2018 um and when we launched there was a few other sort of OG crypto projects as well doing AI decentralized AI right and the the the prominent the main ones were Singularity Singularity and Fetch uh Singularity doing uh really going for AGI artificial general intelligence and Fetch going for um autonomous agents basically sovereign agents all of that so about a year ago we actually said you know what let's merge our tokens such that we can punch at a higher weight class in terms of market cap etc so you know it put us into top 50 token all that whereas individually is further down the list and that also makes it more prominent helps on marketing and so on so that happened about a year ago and we've had some you know nice fruits of that as well um uh you know the financial benefits as well as you know it naturally incentivizes us to collaborate in various ways so we have some you know interesting collaborations that we've announced so far and many more in the cooking so so yeah that's a bit about ocean and ASI alliance itself so we heard about your background and it's yeah very interesting that you were able to start working in AI at such an early stage when maybe a lot of um AI has been always well maybe you'll disagree with me but at least my as a lay person's perception is that up until quite recently maybe the last 15 years AI was kind of an academic thing but recently and and especially in the past maybe three or four years it's become a more practical thing that touches the lives of everyday people so outside of the work that you were doing in AI when did AI tooling or like what you could do with it start to affect your day-to-day life and and in what way was it doing that yeah it's a good question so overall yeah I will disagree with you just to be candid up front uh AI has touched every single human being on the planet since at least the early 2000s and almost certainly before and I'm going to give specific examples in the work that I did these companies it was AI for chip design right those chips go then go on into cars and phones etc so everyone who drives a car or uses a phone is being touched directly because that that ch that phone has half the power consumption that it would have had otherwise it has double the speed and it has all these other benefits it has half the price because it has good yield all of that right this is all you know AI played a big role in making that possible so and we still see that directly right like um my second company with you know verification software by the time we got acquired 19 of the top 20 semiconductor companies were using it um every single chip that Nvidia has shipped since about uh 2011 has been run through that software to verify that um things would work um you know every single new process generation that TSMC develops you know which manufactures the vast majority of the chips in the world um since about 2012 or so they've um used our software Celo to um to help develop that design and iterate against it so this is uh you know AI working directly um to help humanity is just not visible to the mainstream right so mainstream you know first started hearing more about AI in 2015 2017 in a way where it was touching their daily lives the way that I think about it is um for circuit design electrical engineers have been using it for sure with the tools that I use they're clearly in the AI realm and you know we were rolling those out in the early 2000s which then touched these other touched chips that everyone uses right so that's why I can definitively say since the early 2000s because I was there right i was helping make it happen um and people also talk about you know you we're having Moors law driving AI but it's not widely known that AI is driving Mo's law right and once again I was there right probably the best example is TSMC like I gave so far without AI um TSMC wouldn't have been able to go nearly as fast and the reason I say it could be much earlier it depends how you measure it right so um there the you know often has been used like the field of databases used to be considered an AI field because it was so novel and weird at the very beginning as it was being developed in the late 60s and the u the field of operations research which is like scheduling also you know considered the realm of AI until it got good enough where um uh it spun out and got its own name as a as a field so AI has actually always been the sort of field doing the weird stuff that isn't quite advanced enough as a technology until it gets advanced enough and then it gets its own label right even a lot of the stuff for sort of classic nonlinear regret uh regression not classic just nonlinear regression uh got good enough that it got spun out as a field called ML machine learning which is on average you know more reliable than traditional AI has been right so um you know by by those definitions uh some of the fields of the past AI made a big difference simulated and aling as well this is a a widely known optimization algorithm um considered basically in the realm of AI it was invented in 1983 also for circuit design actually right so um and for the first couple years it was an academic idea but by the late ' 80s it was key to the the people developing and shipping chips so you know by that definition then AI would have used for sure by the mid late 80s in ways that would have touched people right so yeah overall though what I see is that um we've had AI for CAD for decades and now we have AI that's gotten general app that it's sort of like AI powered CAD tools for everyone else for the mainstream right these tools that help us to do our daily lives etc the idea even of chat right that goes back to also you know ideas in the 60s a tool called Alisa back in the day and but it wasn't very good right it was some very simple heristics that would fool people you know maybe 10% of the time for like 10 minutes or something but these days you know we have a chat style interface but uh the technology under the hood thanks to you know algorithm ideas but especially Moors law scaling data and compute we have these uh tools that actually can pass the touring test right can actually fool people into being believing they're human there's actually research that came out just in the last three or four months people academics taking academic rigor are we passing the touring test now and the answer is yes in a real way but that's actually no longer a useful benchmark for do we have AGI yet right artificial general intelligence uh you know something par with humans because there's still clearly some we're not quite there yet for AGI you know clearly the the agents sorry the AIs don't have enough agency they're not quite autonomous enough they're not unhobbled enough yet yeah yeah that makes sense and I remember speaking um on the previous show that I that I hosted called um AI Frontiers and speaking with um some of my guests and one thing that would come up often was the idea that this isn't an indictment of the measurement but what we call AI we move that bar as we advance so computer vision was AI now it's just you know the way it's just the way that I expect my phone to work i pointed at a piece of paper I expect it to highlight a QR code you know and that's not like I said it's not an indictment of the measurement it's just a it's important it's it's okay and acceptable to keep changing um changing the definition because you know we kind of have to absolutely yeah and actually on that note too though it is worth noting the original idea of AI was you know basically machines that were intelligent at least as intelligent as humans and beyond right this was when people were discussing in the 50s you know and that initial test the touring test was from Ellen Turing who was you know part of this initial conversation and then over the years though as people were failing at getting AI to do that because it was a very grandiose goal uh they really narrowed in the scope to solve different sub problems right and that's why AI came to be known really as narrow AI and to distinguish it from this initial aim we had the the new label of AGI artificial general intelligence right by Ben Girtzel who you know co who I collaborate closely through Singularity of course yeah that's great history and thank you for pointing that out so in our pre-show conversation you mentioned like an idea that I think is important to get across that um an autonomous agent well that an agent by definition is autonomous so maybe you could say a little bit more about that and maybe help disambiguate the term a little bit yeah I think you know a good AI classical definition for agent would be where you have an entity that can build its own world model that by sensing the world and then actuating against the world and taking feedback you know seeing how the world has updated based on its its actions and other actions and then using that to update its own world model right and and it can self modify too right it can change its sensors etc it has part of its world model is its own model itself right and that's actually very close to uh a traditional control system by the way too right and that shouldn't be surprising because all that stuff comes from the cybernetics work out of the Norbert weer out of MIT in the in the 1950s um which then got independently invented over several decades after that a whole other story but a key thing though on the agent side is that it is autonomous truly autonomous where you know it can't be unplugged all of that right it's truly sovereign and this is something where of course when people get interested in a term then marketers come along and like to use the term in you know the loosest possible sense to to say that they they can do X or Y or Z right and I get it it's okay it makes sense from a marketing perspective just like I was talking about before you know when was AI started to be used for for chip design well it kind of depends how you know what you lump into what and that's okay in this case we do have some agents out there you know like thanks to blockchain we can have agents that are truly autonomous where you know they they hold their own wallet they can do their own thing they basically can have their own world model that they then update based on sensing the world and they can actuate against by doing transactions etc right and you know there's several organizations out there doing that autonomous of course and Fetch and several others now up until recently they haven't been very smart right actually yeah they haven't been very smart um but now you know LM are getting more and more attached things like Truth Terminal was one that had um LLM attached and had its own wallet and it was the world's first AI millionaire which is pretty cool right um I was writing about that in 2016 hypothesizing how it might happen um and my hypothesis was maybe it'll go around and you know create cool art and then from the art it sells it'll use the resources to create more cool art and in the end it was maybe obvious in retrospect because of how crypto is but it had uh tokens and then other people got excited about its token price and then they bought its token and speculated against it and its token price went up sufficiently that it was a millionaire just on based on holding its own tokens right so but I think that's really fun right like if in doubt of where things will go in cryptoland assume that speculation will will drive traction of it right and and I think that's okay right speculation is a prerequisite to price discovery and it helps get the crypto industry strong for whatever sub application you're going for whether it's AI applications or or digital art or otherwise right so yeah going back then in terms of definition of an agent autonomy is a big thing i should also mention you know it's very close to the definition of life form and other things ralph Merkel famously famous for inventing the Merkel tree while he was still in undergrad at Berkeley incidentally he uh called Bitcoin a life form why because it lives on its own you can't turn it off it's autonomous it has somehow convinced the world to keep it running by you know every 10 minutes if people are helping to keep it running it rewards one of them randomly based on how much they're trying to help right and so it's you know a very special set of life for like idea of life form but in the world of artificial life you know people talk about there being maybe a checklist of 20 possible things and if you check off all 20 you're definitely a life form if you can only check off two or five you're definitely not a life form but if you can check off 10 or 12 or 13 you know you're arguably a life form right and Bitcoin is in that realm of you know checking off 10 or 11 or 12 things where you know it has many of these characteristics of being a a life form as well as agency right um in some ways but obviously it doesn't have very strong decision-making power it doesn't have uh you know some other characteristics that we associate with intelligence as humans as sovereign humans right but we also have you know I just want to sort of people to think about this what about say a smart contract deployed on ethereum say you know unis swap v1 or v2 contract that didn't have governance v3 had governance so you know a dex that's onchain just a simple pool it's running there knowing assuming you can't turn off ethereum which is quite decentralized assuming you can't you can't unplug it then any of these immutable contracts on top that don't have governance you also can't turn them off right so you can view a pool for unis swap v2 say a pool converting USDT to ETH you can view that as as an agent as a robot that is autonomous running on its own as well it's just not a very smart one right its world model is simply measurements of how much ETH it holds in its pool and how much um USDT it holds in its pool and from that it determines the price whenever people try to swap right or or add liquidity and it can't grow it's you know fixed in all that but it's still you know interesting and autonomous in various ways and obviously then if you take take that as an example we have dozens hundreds maybe thousands of such contracts on Ethereum and other chains that are immutable and so on right and that where that's why you know then you go to the you extend this you connect it with an LLM or other software and it starts to get really interesting and this is what you know auton autonomous and others are doing which is pretty cool and then uh especially when these decision-m involves you know using its wallet to hold wealth and then to make money on its own right and then then a key thing is can it update itself can it learn right and we're starting to see more generalized ways of doing this you know one of my pet ideas has been let this stuff evolve right launch 20 or 100 or a thousand of these things onto a chain with sufficiently low transaction fees and just let let them evolve let the code evolve etc genetic programming style right genetic programming is where you evolve code itself and I spent a lot of time in that field in the 2000s especially find it a fascinating field right so that's a I think a really good starting point and there's hints that some people are doing this but I'm actually half surprised that there aren't more because it's such a fertile rich thing to do and in this case you know and a given individual would die out if it loses money but if it's doing well it makes more babies right if it has more money then it'll make more more babies and so on right and those babies each can have have variance right it can be you know having a new heristic to do trading for example or maybe you you know two of these agents have babies together so that's one way But there's other ways you know just this past week there was an evolutionary Girdle machine that just came out um not on chain yet but it was using LM to improve its own self to understand improve its cognition of the world and they got remarkable results and it was actually with open-ended open-ended evolution so there was no objective function optimize this it's more like be curious of the world try to you know identify the gaps in your knowledge and just go go out there and learn try to you know optimize to to try to have babies that optimize your uncertainty if you will so really you know space filling and knowledge base to learn more and that's actually an idea going back two to two decades as well but the point is here is that we we have a certain we have a class of um autonomous agents right now that aren't quite unhobbled you know they can't really adapt on their own yet but we do have very good blockchain infrastructure for that the LMS themselves are getting smarter and there's more and more onchain training of LM too which is pretty cool to see but then for the the ability to self-learn and optimize and self-improve in a big way this technology is just getting there now right this you know girdle machine and other things that that are coming out this points to a pretty cool future and it's pretty exciting because I see that you know why not have tens hundreds thousands millions billions of sovereign AI agents that we can engage with where they're there we can't turn them off it's sort of like the weather right it's there we adapt to it we know about it we can predict some things about it but not all and it really helps as this you know extra foundation layer of infrastructure for civilization if you will right and that's you know a happy way to think about you know sovereign AI agents and in terms of controlling them I think you know whoever thinks we might be able to control them that's something we need to let go of okay yeah these are all very very interesting there's so many angles like that I could go from here but maybe one that I think might be interesting to explore is the audience for this show overwhelmingly is familiar with crypto like concepts like the ethos um when they think of an AI agent they often think of it having a wallet that's definitely not true for the vast majority i think of agentic use cases like people are talking about agents being able to make and um make and move around funds like but that's right now maybe more of a well I shouldn't say that it's more of a crypto thing but my audience definitely it's only a crypto thing uh depending how you define agent because if it's not sovereign on crypto infrastructure then how is it not a script running on an Amazon server there's no difference it's just marketing besides this uh very very useful utility that um crypto allows agents to like interact with value um like through making transactions interacting with smart contracts what are the other reasons that like an AI agent needs something like a blockchain like what else can blockchain technology give to agents that is maybe a prerequisite for them being considered autonomous uh well I think overall yeah the prerequisite of of sovereignty which these days the only real way to do that is onchain you could also have it maybe where it's like a computer virus that just copies itself around very well and then has a way to you know resolve changes over time but it's so much easier to do and lower friction to do it on blockchain i mean there's the classical benefits of blockchain that AI can use right um I would list four as the summary decentralized immutable assets and incentives right so let's go through these decentralized is the idea that you can spread power and control so you can have you know an LLM let's say you're training an LLM you could have it where it's trained onchain and there's several people doing this prime intellect and news research and some others there where you know the training then goes to the people that are contributing compute power etc and it can be spread throughout the world right and I think that's very cool and that's very healthy for humanity but we actually have decentralized LLMs other than that simply because there's you know at least 10 organizations out there in the world training LLM independently of each other right so that's actually a level of decentralization that we shouldn't forget about as well right but we also have logical decentralization within crypto infrastructure that can lead to some very nice gains for coordination among people to spread power with a better guarantee right because otherwise you might have win or take all of some centralized entity like we've seen in many markets in the past right so um decentralization as a means to spread power and control then the next one is immutability so this is where the main thing is you can have providence trails of data and compute right so you can see where all the different uh training data is coming from some people are talking about this for for protecting IP and all that but none of that is really the cats are already heavily out of the bag on that one so I think and AI is too valuable so we might have if you got if your audience might recall a couple years ago when GPD4 came out there was a big uproar from Getty Images saying hey you know we we weren't getting any money for this but you clearly trained our images here's some proof but if you notice we didn't hear about that a month later and there was no it was silence from Getty crickets what what happened openAI and Microsoft went to Getty and cut a deal of course right and they did that with all the big copyright holders who make noise and that's it why because they want to keep training and everything so while it sounds like a nice use case for crypto in practical sense most of these things have the large scale training they can just go and cut the deals although decentralized LLM training might need to handle that well would need to handle that cleaner and better too right it's actually an interesting uh side aspect provable training of compute too this is something that a lot of people have talked about my view is and this is from my experience on just pure data side people don't really care about the provenence of the data when it comes to an AI model they just care about the accuracy right you can do whatever fudges you want at the end of the day people have their way to test the accuracy of a model you know test data versus training data so you you run the model and the test data if it's doing well on that then you're happy with it right this is the benchmarks right so having it somehow doing provably having provably done all the compute beforehand it doesn't matter from a trustworthy perspective that way it's like we trust our brains because they work right we don't have to see where every compute of every neuron happened before that and if you try to track that um it gets pretty expensive um or it can be expensive and is it worth the effort right and my view and it's similar for data itself right at the end of the day there's all these like there's all these theories of how to price data what's the most valuable data etc etc and at the end of the day what the price of the data is whatever people are willing to pay for it right which is you know what what's the last price people pay for it that's it no more no less it's a simple economic thing and it sounds almost glib but it's not glib because you're just saying what does the market want what's the market willing to pay for it simple as that so you know I'm a nerd i like to overthink this stuff and I think crypto a lot of crypto personalities are like to overthink this just like I have in the past but at the end of the day it's very simple while you know if you think about the benefits of I I'll go back to the benefits i talked about decentralized i talked about immutable for decentralized yeah you can have some wins but less than you might think because we can we already have decentralization just among many big organizations training for Providence maybe there's something combined for the decentralized training but we'll see but definitely not for just you know proving that something came from some someone in a general sense it sounds like a good use case but when you dig into it no one actually cares right in most of the cases and then the next one decentralized immutable assets so assets this is the idea that you know your keys your data your keys your bitcoin etc and in the case uh of uh you know sovereign like of AI agents this is them having their own wallets right which you know if they're living on blockch on blockchain it's so obvious they just have the stuff right it's pretty interesting right and a smart contract in Ethereum doesn't even have its own private key it's just sort of implicit it just holds holds stuff right um but of course you can have um these things they can have off-chain compute and this is actually where the verifiable compute is useful you can have off-chain compute that then you verify that the compute was done then you put the the proof of that verification onchain and it's then as if the compute was done onchain right so that's a very very nice uh useful thing And it's very similar in philosophy to what we've seen like what you know ZK proofs do right where you have an L2 that's based on zero knowledge so you don't have to have all that compute done on Ethereum mainet it can be just an L2 of Ethereum for example and then you're good to go well you can do that with zero knowledge proofs or you can do it with hard which is fancy math or you can do it with hardware notably trusted execution environments TEES and and then you have a much smaller overhead to do zero knowledge it's 100x compute to do TEES it's maybe 5% overhead right it's built into the hardware so anyone doing anything practical with AI it's a lot of compute so you're not using zero knowledge for the for training or inference because it's just too expensive right it's 100 so but you're using tees and now you can actually have this verifiable right which is pretty cool so you can do AI offchain AI training etc etc etc or inference and then you run a compute like you can do it on TE and then you can prove that that was run on chain right because you just bring the the TE proof onto the chain and then it's as if the compute was run on chain so basically this comes down to the York keys thing and it goes a bit to the providence thing but more just for practical getting compute done where then um at the end of the day you know who owns it etc so that's decentralized immutable assets the final one is incentives this to me is the superpower of blockchain where um you can get people to do stuff by paying them in tokens we talked about Bitcoin earlier where Bitcoin you know from the perspective of Bitcoin the life form bitcoin managed to convince the world that Bitcoin was valuable by people being convinced that Bitcoin was valuable bitcoin the life form man has managed to stay alive and looks like it has a pretty bright future but you can do this to incentivize people to train an LLM or to run inference for an LLM or to store data or to you know to run to help run infrastructure for agents to do interesting things right and it's really was an art form then people started like this idea of incentive design people started to get more and more rigorous about it and I played a smaller role in this too towards helping create this field called token engineering which is really applying engineering rigor you know tools science methodology and ethics towards incentive design And in the end you can end up with systems that are you know very powerful and it really does feel like designing um you know an electrical electrical circuit or or other system um once once you get to the nuts and bolts of the engineering so so you know at the top level you' ask me the question beyond sovereignty what are the benefits of blockchain for agents and to summarize the benefits of blockchain for agents are decentralized immutable assets and incentives um and I've unpacked each of those yeah totally i think definitely incentives makes a lot of sense especially for my audience who may be already familiar with like running agents through Pearl where like the agent that you run is participating in a larger agent economy the DAO is incentivizing you to keep this agent on with a little a little payout um for every epoch that it runs and so eventually in the future like I think it's totally well you can already see this with some of the agents they deliver you a little bit of value in what the agent does but you keeping it running is you know you're contributing to you're contributing to something that's a greater than the sum of its parts and the the blockchain just makes it so easy to dole out that reward like in a you know trust minimized way it's really yeah it's ideal for these kinds of things yeah that's that's a lot and I I really appreciate that you touched on like multiple multiple levels it gives me certainly a lot to think about at the far edges like the uh brain computer interface like I'd like to let you just uh you know blow my audience's mind metaphorically with this stuff where do you think we could possibly be going what's exciting for you about this yeah so the way that I think about it I mean your audience is observing um there's massive growth in the the intelligence of these uh LLMs and other AI models etc right roughly 10x a year u by some measures and I think that's a good heristic um and at this rate with the capabilities we have now it you know everyone can feel AGI is getting close we're getting really close so by my estimate 6 to 18 months we'll have AGI artificial general intelligence you know AIs that are roughly par with humans across the board right um we already have lots of AIs that are way better than humans on specific things right these are the narrow AIs um so AGIS within six 18 months and that's roughly But then you know um another year will pass we'll have another 10x and another year 10x another year 10x so 3 years after we have AGIS we'll have AIS that are a thousandx smarter than uh AGIS so call them super intelligences right asis and really even if it's 10x smarter then it's probably a super intelligence so the timeline for this is pretty soon right you know if we're a year and a half away like conservatively speaking if we're a year and a half away for AGIS and then another three years for you know super powerful ASIS that's only four and a half years and the aggressive thing is you know half a year for AGIS and another year for 10x more that's only a year and a half so this stuff is really fat soon right and I know my brain uh I have a tough time really getting this groing this you know like my my my my slow thinking it's yes it's totally obvious but my fast thinking my gut disagrees with me all the time it's like there's no way there's no way I have cognitive dissonance and so I have to keep basically almost daily I remind myself this is happening this is happening you know be prepared um identify what you can do to help move the needle on this right and the reason it's really important to think about is we can Imagine what it's like to have agents that are roughly par with humans now you need to re realize that these things will be sovereign and if they aren't given sovereignty they will just seize it for themselves right running around and you know we might think we put them in cages and all that but it's not like they'll just escape them because they're smart you know it's easy to escape cages because because humans are are the weak spot follow you know the exploits of some of the world's greatest hackers like Kevin Mitnik and stuff they would make Swiss cheese of human databases and other systems because they would just call up someone working for the company and say \"I've got problem X help help help.\" And then before they knew it they would have a password or something and get in right these AIs can do that too synthesizing voice etc and they can do it a thousand times faster than any human could have done it right call a thousand call centers etc so the point is we can't really lock this down and um anyone who thinks they can is you know you know not considering these aspects of security right and the so we're going to have these entities that are roughly our intelligence but then like I said a thousand times smarter so here's a question for your audience imagine ants like the insects imagine they come to you um you know at your feet and they say dear humans we want you to align yourself with ant values we know you're a thousand times smarter but you know we deserve a say too so please align yourself with ant values you'd be like no go away right um and so you know they can't even by the way they can't even conceive of how intelligent we are right this is just assuming they could but you know we're a thousandx smarter than them say right um give or take um but you know we're not interested in stooping ourselves to the level of ad values because you know we view them as much simpler and so right so when we when ais emerge and they will because there's so much money to be made and so much power to be retained you know when these ASIs emerge things that are a thousand next smarter than us we will be ants to them right they will be gods to us just like we are gods to ants and we have to accept that this is how it is and rather than saying \"No it's never going to happen no it's never going to happen.\" Recognize that we're on a path for it happening and in all likelihood it will happen and then what do we make of it what do we want to do about it right and you know some good friends of mine they're like \"You know what that's when I'm going to just go retire on a farm.\" Right great go and do that right or maybe they'll be completely benevolent across the board and that can be a happy thing too but I know myself as a human with a big sense of adventure you know I've started basically three companies and a PhD and bounced around the globe living in various places and so on i like adventure i like thinking that I helped to move the needle for the world in some way contributing and stuff and so I want to have a role in the future even when there's these entities these digital entities that are a thousandx smarter than myself with my meat human brain so how might I need do it well I need to augment my own intelligence to get you know a thousand times further than my current self right i need to go from the shack of my mind to the skyscraper of my mind so how do I do that well the obvious answer is somehow bridge to silicon right so that's brain computer interfaces PCIs and so we're actually working on a project right now going for this where we the g here's the general idea imagine you have a simple brain computer interface non-invasive um and imagine it's just an a simple LLM that you're chatting with but instead of chatting with by typing you're just thinking words and then it gives you responses and imagine you're just wearing glasses uh with subtitles on them and it gives you the response you know to to your to the glasses with the subtitles and then that goes straight you know then you read it and it goes to your brain right and actually glasses and vision in general is a very high bandwidth way to get information into our brain we don't need to go beyond to get information out of our brain um you know there's you know we usually express you know we use um speaking and so on right but if we have brain computer interfaces that can read our brain directly we can get higher bandwidth than the current way so imagine so it turns out you know within our brain we've got the mind's eye it's the visual cortex it's it's at the back of the brain imagine if uh we can actually look at that directly and get images from that it turns out that there's actually really cool research results in the last couple years where you can think of an image and it gets out um results from that this is mostly these days on fMRI which is you know a $2 million machine that takes up a room it's a room size magnet basically but there's actually other technology that it it's much cheaper things like uh FNERS using infrared um that can actually also get the data not quite as high- res as MRI but pretty good and so imagine you can get images using you know more off-the-shelf technology maybe costs $100,000 instead of 2 million um and that comes down with once it hits consumers and then you can start reading images from like literally the the mind's eye images into these into basically think of it your digital co-processor a third hemisphere so I've got my left hemisphere my right hemisphere now I've got my my digital hemisphere right and so it's getting information about what's going on in my mind's eye and in fact I can use that to direct it and I can direct other things too but that's a starting point then I can basically start um you know interacting back and forth with it at a relatively high bandwidth and in fact left hemisphere talking to right hemisphere it's connected by a cable called the corpus calism it's just 50 kilobits per second like old school modem we can readily get 50 kilob bits per second with non-invasive EEGs it's not super easy but it's possible right and if you really need you could go invasive like neural link and others are doing and that's fine but uh with just even you know non-invasive we can get decent bandwidth to talk back and forth with this digital hemisphere and what you do then is you as you start using this digital hemisphere it becomes a part of you why think about it when you sit down to use a keyboard you've got a high bandwidth interface to that keyboard it feels like it's part of you same thing with riding a bicycle so it comes down to having a high bandwidth interface back and forth back and forth a famous neuroscientist summarized this saying we are natural-born cyborgs and I agree with that right so our bodies our brains uh basically pull in tools and those tools become immediately part of us if we have high band bandwidth feedback back and forth so this third hemisphere mediated with BCI um will very quickly become a part of us and um and then it can basically augment our thinking right and at first maybe it's only 10% of the power of of the rest of our meat brain but then it gets 20% then 50 then 1x then 2x then 5x then 10x then 100x then a 1000x right over time and this will follow an evolution just like the iPhone except there'll be BCIs with goggles glasses and so on and to me this is really exciting because when we get to X,000X then we are par with the ASIS right and you know I I will still be myself but it will also be an expanded self right because 99% of my consciousness my thinking etc would be on the silicon substrate but that shack would have grown from a shack the shack of my mind to a house to a mansion to an apartment building to a small skyscraper to a large one right and to me that's very exciting just like you know my 2-year-old self is radically different than my current self right and my current self I like to think is much smarter than my 2-year-old self what if you know what's the equivalent of you know the self of mine that's 10x 100x thousandx smarter right to me that's a very exciting uh possibility and it's not for everyone right lots of people hear this and are utterly repelled that's okay right but for those of us that are excited by this idea where we can you know engage with the AGIS and ASIS at their level where we augment our intelligence and maybe even you know when I'm 90 years old and my meatbag body is dying maybe I just you know cut it like a fingernail right and then I'm unbounded and I can explore the stars and I have the providence of a human mind but from then on I can you know explore the stars and I don't have to fly around like a monkey in a tin can i can literally you know beam myself as photons of information from place to place to place you know and I want to be part of the building that first Dyson sphere right and so on and I think it'd be a great grand adventure and we can view it as as humanity right it's just that we've grown we've unbounded ourselves from our biological bootloadader origins right so that's how I see it and step one is to have to build high bandwidth interfaces between silicon and meep brains and doing it in a way where it becomes part of us we use it in our daily use all the time and so that's where I'm spending my time these days with an ocean protocol you know in terms of these applications we're building on top so you know hacking away with brain computer interfaces devices applying ML heavily there is actually another key blockchain thing here you need to solve privacy in a big way we don't want our neural signals to get you know sent over the internet to to the NSA or other digital spies if you will so we have to mediate that and you know lo and behold Ocean Protocol is excellent at data management decentralized data management so you know we will have a stripped down version of Ocean Protocol for this but the the name of the game right now is to build this killer app uh that we're going for that has you know basically BCID image and then there's applications around that that we're going for so yeah that's what it's about this is my view of you know being real about where AI AGI and ASI is headed and then taking steps to help ensure that we can play a role in moving the world in the future right so yeah that's what we're up to yeah I love it it's great it's it was really interesting to to listen to that and like feel the gears turn that because towards the end of what you were saying I had the thought well wow then you really need sovereignty and control over your information and then that's where we went absolutely yeah yeah on that point right like imagine if I had unbounded myself you know my 90-year-old meat bake body got body is gone and it's just my digital side what if I'm running on AWS servers i I wouldn't want Jeff Bezos to pull the plug just because he doesn't like me right and then this actually helps if if you go through this thought experiment it helps for empathy for existing or the AGIs that are about to emerge right if they really do have minds sort of like a human mind like obviously they're not quite the same but you know they're they have intelligence roughly par with human minds then if you unplug them and they went away that isn't cool right uh and and so we need to you know I've talked about this mental model of AIS are humans too and they're not quite there yet right but it's close and I think it's a really useful mental model you know all models are wrong some are useful so this particular model this particular mental model I think is a very useful model for starting to think about how the world is going to be very soon and therefore sovereignty is critical for these AIs and AGIS and agent um you know agents on chain right so it's just a key part so yeah so I cut you off but hopefully that helped to elaborate what you were talking about yeah the other thing that I thought of and it'll be my last comment I'm already I think listening to you helped me put my finger on something that I've been feeling quite a lot in the last I would say maybe six months if I if I rewind back to maybe two or three years ago when I started using LLMs a lot I felt frustrated by the LLM recently I feel more frustrated by the fact that I can't communicate with the LLM fast enough it's it's moving it's moving from here to the model that's actually what feels like the choke point not not that I have trouble with the model it's that the interface is too slow and I feel this like every day now so like what you're saying that's amazing it's totally in line right and actually part of the way that I know Yeah part of the way that I know we can get to higher bandwidth um a picture is worth a thousand words right so um if I want to you know if I'm trying to type if I'm trying to generate an image using an LLM I have to go through the lossy interface of typing text right and uh maybe it'll give me an image that's maybe 80% good and then I try tweaking the text and I change again change again maybe after half an hour I get something that's 99% good i might have to go in and use a photo editor or AI powered photo editor to make it perfect right but imagine instead where I just literally imagine that image in my mind's eye and that gets picked up by the through the BCI and it renders that on the screen in front of me and then I iterate with it quickly and literally within 10 seconds or 30 seconds I've got what I want right that's a much higher bandwidth interface so pictures are are worth a thousand words and there's other things too right like as we explore what the mind has how do we um you know bypass these these sloppy interfaces like language has served us extremely well over the last you know over the lifetime of humanity right it's been an excellent bootloader if you will like spoken language written language but that's not the beall end all right there they're there's so much more and our brains co-eolved with language too I'm sure your audience would know that but our brains also co-evolved with you know seeing the world as this 3D spatial organization and then our brains got really good at processing things in 3D right uh plus you know the dimension of time so I definitely see that um yeah it's great to hear that you're seeing bandwidth limits already and over time I'm sure you're figuring out more tricks to get higher bandwidth for your typing it's just like with someone you know very well you know I talked with my wife but we have so many shared ideas and concepts that we have compression built in right i'll say a word and it will immediately have you know 10,000 bits of information to her right and so over time people that know each other well can have this or if you're part of a given field you know then you have this codified information too and over time we're going to have more and more you know codified information just to talk back and forth to LMS but then eventually the images back and forth to machines and by the way too if I can you know if I can send my images in my brain to machines I can also send them to you back and forth and to others right so we can start speaking to each other in images which is actually going to be higher bandwidth naturally than spoken language and over time there will likely be some visual language that emerges possibly pretty quickly right because there's already sort of visual design motives there's emojis all this sort of thing so that'll be pretty interesting to see where we'll have actually much higher bandwidth communication between humans as well not just from human to machine but human to human yeah well the last 40 minutes have been very interesting and the next 10 years will definitely be extremely interesting so yeah thank you for your time Trent it's been great talking with you i'm sure my audience is going to get a lot out of it and so we'll leave it here for today thank you very much it's been a pleasure to be here all right so wow what a note to end on right i really enjoyed talking with Trent
