AI i'm your host Thomas Maybreer and I'm the digital media producer for Valerie one of the core contributors to OLS if you haven't heard of or you haven't heard of Agents Unleashed let me quickly take a moment to tell you a little bit about both so Olus is the best way for anyone to own and monetize their AI agent and that includes people just like you you can learn more about how to do that at ol.network and Agents Unleash isn't just a podcast it's also the premier event series for people interested in AI agents events have been held all over the world with over 77 speakers and presenters and more than 2500 inerson attendees the next event has already been announced it'll be held June 30th in Ken and registrations are currently open you'll definitely want to grab a slot fast it is free to attend but previous events have hit capacity you can find a link for more information about the event in the show notes or the description box all right so on this episode of the show we're going to take a look at the current state of AI through the eyes of some major leaders in the space i've got some interesting stuff to share with you from Sam Alman of Open AI and Dario Amade from Anthropic we're also going to look at a new advancement in the world of open source models from Bite Dance and we'll close the show today with a look at the world's first fully AI generated scientific discovery to be accepted at a major academic conference okay so we'll start with Sam Alman who recently appeared at the Snowflake Summit he made some very interesting comments there about what he expects we might see in AI over the next year i've got a clip for you so let's check that out i think we'll be at the point next year where you can not only use a system to sort of automate some business processes or build these new products and services but you can really say I have this hugely important problem in my business i will throw a ton of compute at it if you can solve it and the models will be able to go figure out things that teams of people on their own can't do i would bet next year that in some limited cases at least in some small ways we start to see agents that can help us discover new knowledge or can figure out solutions to business problems that are kind of very non-trivial um right now it's it's very much in the category of okay if you got some like repetitive cognitive work we can automate it at a kind of a low level on a short time horizon and so what an enterprise will be able to do we talked about this a little bit but just like give it your hardest problem if you're a chip design company say \"Go design me a better chip than I could have possibly had before.\" Um if you're a biotech company trying to cure some disease say \"Just go work on this for me.\" Like that's not so far away okay so it's a relatively short clip but there's a lot to unpack there what I think it should get us thinking about is the road map for the immediate future right now as Alman correctly points out AI is great for automating repetitive cognitive work that's essentially where we use an AI as a productivity multiplier on tasks that we already know how to do what Altman is predicting is that AI could soon become a strategic problem solver for a business this would be where a business would be able to take its hardest problem so some business challenge that even their internal team of experts haven't been able to solve and then delegate that to the AI which then goes away and autonomously discovers a workable solution if we look at the examples that he gives like the chip company trying to design a better chip the biotech firm working on a disease in these hypotheticals what I think we need to seriously consider is the possibility that AI will soon be able to take the lead on innovation in this way and discover solutions that are in Sam's words very non-trivial there's also an interesting angle about the potential future of work here because it's possible that in the very near future instead of having a human orchestrate a team of junior level colleagues perhaps complementing them with a non-agentic AI Alman is forecasting a future where we might be able to just deploy an AI to tackle the work that those junior level colleagues might have done for us this is quite different than the way most businesses and individuals currently use AI but with the pace of innovation lately it does seem more and more possible as is always the case with these thought leaders we should take their ideas and comments with a grain of salt their timelines might be overly optimistic adoption might not take off in the way that they expect there could be other blockers that they're just not considering but we should still take their ideas seriously this idea that AI has the potential to discover truly unique novel knowledge is the core premise behind much of the work that's going into agentic AI right now it's worth taking seriously this idea that with sufficient autonomy and computational power these systems could move beyond simply remixing existing information and move into the domain of actually discovering new and novel solutions and ideas as I'll share with you at the end of the show we already have a concrete example of an AI that has potentially done just that in the world of science which lends some real weight to Altman's predictions so moving on another big story this week came from anthropic co Daario Amade who did an interview with Axios where he made quite a few big statements and predictions about what he sees happening in the future of work over the next 10 years his ideas definitely rhyme a little bit with Sam's comments amod says that he thinks advanced AI could wipe out a significant number of entry-level white collar jobs up to 50% in the next 10 years i think that sounds like a lot but again it is worth taking this idea seriously because one of the implications is that we as consumers should be actively thinking about ways that we can learn to augment ourselves with these AI tools this way we stand the best chance of becoming orchestrators of the AI rather than having our productivity or our value completely replaced by them ammo mentions in the interview that anthropics research shows that right now AI models are being mainly used for augmentation that is to say they help humans achieve their goals however he says that over time he expects companies are going to tip more towards full automation so this would be where the AI performs the task from end to end he also reminds us in the interview that OpenAI Google Anthropic they're all vastly improving the capabilities of their models and in many areas they're already meeting or exceeding human level performance the other thing important to mention here is the pace of innovation is only speeding up so if you're watching or listening to the show you're probably already thinking about this but I think the truth is most people are not so maybe we should consider this a call to action to either begin or restart that discussion with friends family and colleagues that maybe aren't thinking about it as much as you and I are this could be an important time to communicate to those people that this is all very much real and while there is tremendous potential there's also great risk for those who allow themselves to remain uninformed even just in simple ways like having their life be a little harder than it needs to be so my conclusion here is that white collar entry-level jobs almost certainly are under threat to some extent there is a good chance that they do go away in the form that they currently exist in but I also think that it's possible that what becomes expected from entry-level human performance just becomes different to give an example perhaps in a few years an entry-level type task is more about thinking through what problems to bring to an autonomous agentic AI so you would be looking at designing the experiment whereas in contrast to today you might be expected to do all of the work yourself as I said a few times already in the episode and definitely on previous episodes of the show this is the best time to be looking for ways to get involved with AI and in particular learning about AI agents running an AI agent through Pearl the agent app store for example could be a good way to dip your feet in these agents are quite lightweight but by running them every day not only are you contributing to the growth of autonomous AI agent economies you also get a stake of ownership in the future of co-owned AI because the agent that you run is completely owned custodied and operated by you i would definitely encourage you to check it out there'll be a link in the descriptions in the show notes where you can find out exactly how to do that so that's what's been happening on the centralized big tech side of AI now let's take a look at open source as has been the case often lately we're seeing some great advancements and so this week I want to share with you a model from Bite Dance called Bagel i think the roll out of this model was perhaps overshadowed a little bit because the launch announcement came at the same time as Google V3 which we covered on the previous episode of the show i wanted to make sure we gave it a little bit of time because it's a very cool advancement so Bite Dance as you may know is the company that operates Tik Tok in the US among other things and Bagel is a powerful new open- source model that they've created this is a unified multimodal model which means that the UX is very similar to what you would see in Gemini 2.0 Chat DBT40 so it can receive generate and reason over both text and image in the same chat as I've mentioned it's open source and what's really cool about that is its capabilities are comparable to a proprietary model like chat GPT but because it's open source that means it can be fine-tuned altered or adapted for your unique use case this gives it a flexibility that a centralized closed weight model doesn't have as the pace of AI innovation continues to accelerate we're going to need as many different options and tools as we can possibly get our hands on so it's great to see yet another powerful open-source model hit the market there are many use cases where it might not be desirable to rely on a cloud-based foundation model from a centralized player for example like having your application use Gemini's API or using an API from OpenAI to process your users's request or manage data so for those of you watching the show I'm going to put up some examples from their demo video on screen and you'll be able to see that Bagel handles text and image in very much the same way that ChatGpt 40 does you can see that the answers that it gives are quite high quality and it's also capable of image generation where it can discuss and reason over the images that you provide or it creates not only can it generate new images but it can also edit your uploads or make changes to the images that it generates for you like I said before it's really exciting to have such a powerful open- source alternative model available to us this is exactly what we as end users and creators of this alternative world of co-own AI are going to need so yeah I would definitely encourage you to check out Bagel because it is very cool okay so the last thing I want to share with you today is a research paper with a very impressive title it's called Tempest automatic multi-turn jailbreaking of large language models with tree search so this is a paper that describes an interesting and importantly novel way of getting an LLM to break its alignment rules and it does this through exploring different possible jailbreaks in a parallel tree search if the system finds a successful path it then propagates those results across the other branches of the tree so it looks for and finds the most effective attack strategy and then applies it systematically in the paper we can see that it performs quite well on benchmarks and they were able to get good meaningful results so that's something very cool about the paper but the reason that I wanted to talk about it on the show today is the origin of this paper so this paper was created researched and tested entirely by an AI agent it's called Zochi and it was created by Intology specifically for the purpose of scientific discovery so not only did the Zochi agent discover something novel but the paper itself has been accepted to the upcoming Association of Computational Linguistics conference so just to lay everything out really explicitly what we have here is an AI generated paper that's come up with a novel discovery and it's passed the highest level of peer review which is acceptance to the main track of an academic conference so what that means is that this paper will be discussed and hopefully advanced the field in the same way that a human generated discovery would this is a pretty serious stamp of approval in my opinion for this idea that agentic AI can discover novel insights so if you felt or heard or been told that AI isn't capable of producing something new or novel well here you go oh here is a real world example that will be discussed at this conference so once again this is all real and it's all really happening also if you think back to the beginning of today's show where we listened to the comments from Sam Alman just like he said he thinks AI could be capable of discovering new knowledge in the realm of a company or a business well here we have an example of an AI agent discovering new knowledge in the realm of science so clearly he's on to something and this is probably only the beginning okay so that was all a lot of information but before we go I'm going to give you five quick hits of some stories that are interesting but we don't have time to get into the details today so the first is on the collapse of Builder.ai this was a startup that was once valued at over a billion dollars they're going to be shutting down as a part of this process what was discovered was that the chat service they were providing to developers was actually sending requests to a real life team of human coders in India looking at something a little more real the FDA which is the regulatory body which oversees food and drugs in the US recently announced their own generative AI tool called Elsa they're going to be using it to speed up the scientific review process and make the agency more efficient meta is reportedly planning to have its AI tools fully creating and targeting ads by the end of next year ai pioneer Yosua Benjio has launched a new nonprofit called Law Zero they're going to be working on systems that are designed to keep AI honest by using psychological tactics to monitor for harmful behavior so they can interrupt it and lastly Olama announced Secure Minions which allows private collaboration between a locally running Olama model and a cloud-based frontier model it uses a new security protocol from Stanford's Hazy Research to encrypt all local remote communication end to end this way you can ensure that sensitive data remains private even from the cloud provider with minimal effects on performance okay so we'll wrap it up here links to all of the articles videos and resources that we've talked about on the show today can be found in the description box or the show notes before we go I'd like to ask for your support please give this video a thumbs up a star rating a repost a comment share it with your friends family and colleagues it'll really help us to reach new people and grow the show i'd also love to hear from you if you have any feedback or comments please get in touch with me i am Thomas Maybryer on X and don't forget to register for Agents Unleashed in Ken again it's June 30th rsvps are free but space is limited all right we'll leave
