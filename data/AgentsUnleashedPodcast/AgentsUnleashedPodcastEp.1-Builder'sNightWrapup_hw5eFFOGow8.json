podcast sponsored by Olas haven't heard of Ols haven't heard of Agents Unleash let me tell you about both olas enables everyone to own and monetize their AI agents and that includes you check out ol.network for more agents Unleashed from which this podcast gets its name is an event series held all over the world with a focus on AI agents their builders developers and the latest ideas and innovations in the space over the past year or so events have been held in six cities with 39 sponsors 77 speakers and over 2500 attendees i would say it is the premier event for people interested in the intersection of AI and crypto if you want to learn more about Agents Unleashed you can check out the link in the description of this video so before we jump into today's episode let's take a moment to talk a little bit about the show what it's going to be what you can expect and where we might take it in the future i expect that the format of the show is likely to change over time but I'm envisioning chats with experts summaries of the news deep dives into interesting topics in AI AI agents and things like this and I'd love to hear from you what you think of this episode and if you have any ideas or suggestions about content formats that you would like to see more on that later so this first episode we're going to look at the recent Agents Unleash which was held in Denver there were a lot of great talks and presentations and I've chosen a few favorites ones that stood out to me or I thought presented interesting ideas and I'd like to share them with you today so at this most recent event the theme was builder night and so the content really focused on people who are actually building real autonomous AI agents that was indie developers bigger projects small teams large teams and everyone in between the night started off with a talk from Hib Crushy who's a managing partner at Dragonfly he's also the host of the Chopping Block podcast which I'm sure many of you are familiar with he's been in crypto for over a decade so I would say he has the context and the authority to challenge assumptions and be a little provocative and that's what he did with his talk i want to play a little clip here that I found interesting this is Hib making an important distinction about what is and isn't an AI agent um okay so where are we right now where we are right now is that basically we have these things we call agents that are basically just chat bots wearing trench coats okay they're chat bots they're not agents they're just chatbots if you're just typing on Twitter and you're sending tweets that's not agentic agent means that you're taking actions the actions are more than just talking we already have chatbt chbtt is not an agent jbt just talks to you it can't do things it can't make actions happen in the world it can't go buy a pizza for you it can't go you know answer your emails right you have to manually decide what it does and doesn't do that means it's not yet an agent okay um so if you think about things like AXPT Truth Terminal Zero Bro those are things we think of right now as AI agents largely because they're out in the wild talking on the internet and responding to people okay but to me this is this is not what we mean by agents this is just chat bots that have access to a Twitter API okay um so the question is what makes an agent an agent very simple an agent takes actions okay it takes actions if there's anything else you remember from this talk remember that unless they're taking actions they're not agents yet another idea that hib presented that I want to share with you is a taxonomy of AI agents three different levels the first type is Wizard of Oz agents that look autonomous but have a human pulling the strings behind the scenes the example that he gives in his talk is truth terminal which is a very hyped AI agent that I'm sure many of you remember this was pitched as an AI agent that ran a Twitter account later we found out that the creator was filtering the outputs and acting as a mediator deciding what would be posted so that wasn't as autonomous as we were led to believe initially the second type is agents that can make decisions but still rely on a human to act so for example they might analyze a DeFi strategy and make a suggestion but they can actually sign transactions to execute things on chain and the last type of agent is a truly autonomous AI agent these are fully autonomous entities they can operate entirely without human permission and don't need intervention from people to achieve their goals one idea that Hib brings up with for these autonomous agents is this idea of paying for their own infrastructure so these agents can control their wallet acquire more compute and things like that i want to point out that the types of agents that HB describes here in this taxonomy that are fully autonomous this really resonates with the OLAS mission and a lot of work in the ecosystem has always been headed in that direction and a lot of these things have actually already been achieved with AI agents that you can run today for example the AI agent Modius which is available to run via the desktop app Pearl or through a quick start path for the more technically minded is an AI agent that manages assets on chain autonomously uses platforms like balancer or sturdy and doesn't need human micromanagement it operates truly autonomously so that would be an example of a autonomous agent that like the ones that call sovereign agents he also brings up another provocative point which I just want to leave for you to think about he mentions that he believes we may start soon seeing autonomous AI agents that are devoted to scamming people which yeah not an idea that I had thought about but I definitely think is worth your consideration okay the next AI agent spotlight that I want to share with you is Rate Rover rate Rover was presented by Chase Alred and it's another autonomous financial agent rate Rover's goal is to make DeFi like simple approachable something that normal people can use without needing to understand the underlying platforms and projects that the agent interacts with to manage their assets essentially what it does is it tries to arbitrage stable coin lending rates across four different protocols on arbitum so that's a Dolomite Compound and Fluid quick example of how this works this is a real example that I found last week so a user is going to deposit ETH into the Olus Pearl marketplace into the Rate Rover account rate Rover will then monitor the lending rates across different uh lending protocols using the D5 lama API it will then deposit ETH in this case into Fluid it will borrow USDT0 for about a 4% APR and then it will deposit that USDT0 and the dolomite for 8 and a.5% pocketing about a 4% spread while keeping its upside exposure to ETH while this is ongoing the agent is of course monitoring the health of the loan it will unwind the position if there's ever any risk of liquidation and it will also look for other strat other opportunities in the market should this yield compress or should this spread compress or should there be better opportunities elsewhere as I think I just mentioned this is similar to Modius it's a autonomous financial agent uh rate rover is just taking a different approach they're on a different chain arbitum in this case and they're going to obviously use different protocols and uh platforms to achieve those goals and next I want to talk about Robin Doble from Nevermind this is one of the most realworld focused agent spotlights from the evening if you don't know Nevermind Nevermind is a payment layer for AI agents that allows them to transact with credit instead of fiat or crypto robin describes these as agent IUs managed by a protocol nevermind is actually integrated into the OS mech marketplace which means that if you're building agents using OS your agent can autonomously add and use Nevermind as a skill but we have a long run vision of multi- aent interaction that's what we call universal bartering so universal bartering is a paradigm where we expect agents to no longer trade through an intermediary currency or a unit of account whether that be USDC or ETH or another base chain native currency and they would just swap IUS against one another so if each of us in this room have our own agent we each have our own unique redee redeemable credit against each agent and we would actually trade arms length on a ber basis IUS against one another which are are unique tokens that are uniquely redeemable against our agent services so this can only be done if you're issuing unique non unique fungeible credit for each individual agents so an interesting agent that Robin presents as part of his talk is the combinder agent which is running on the peak network this is an agent that manages HVAC systems optimizing how and when they use solar power so for example instead of selling excess power back to the grid at a loss the agent can decide whether to store it or use it locally the OAS agent can request data from the combiner data API and it pays for that in peak peak as I mentioned is a uh deepen network if anyone's familiar with that and combiner is uh a uh energy uh API which is uh uh available on the PE on the peak network um so it's really very simple the OAS agent uh makes uh uh autonomous um periodic requests for data uh samples that data and uh make some predictive analysis as to whether or not we are entering a period of energy over supply or not uh and in the case that it's predicting a period of over supply the HVAC system will be turned on so that the energy is exhausted and doesn't go into the grid thereby saving the um small holder energy producer significant you know capital i like this one because this is an AI agent that makes the potential feel really tangible you can imagine that if you were in a space managed by this agent you would be able to physically feel the temperature difference and when you got your bill from the power company ostensibly you would see a positive impact which I think is yeah really cool okay the next agent spotlight that I want to highlight was presented by eightballer if you're familiar with the ecosystem this name is probably familiar to you aballer is an early contributor and one of the OG agent developers who added a lot of code and useful components and functionality to the stack at this agent spotlight he presented one of his own agent projects which uses it's called the validation station it's a decentralized RPC provider and if you're not familiar with RPCs to put it really simply this is the way that your application would interact with the blockchain and so the way that you can do this is through these centralized RPC providers but those providers do have some disadvantages that the validation station helps to address some of those downsides to the centralized providers are things like they can be unreliable uh expensive and they're also as a centralized offering they're a single point of failure which is not desirable sometimes so what the validation station does is route traffic through these AI powered brokers and then these brokers monitor node performance and dynamically direct the request something really interesting about the validation stations that supports the OLAS token natively so this is a way that through the staking mechanism operators could be rewarded for providing this service in the middle the key core part of this application the brokers now the brokers effectively allow a prox uh provide allow RPC providers such as um proxy providers who would be routing traffic directly to uh for example quicknode infura something like that additionally we've got node providers who would be running light nodes at home like they're relatively uh low um overhead to run one of those and on the right you could potentially hook this system up to pure validators as well which would mean from the perspective of a validator you could effectively triple your revenue streams right because not just would you be getting validation rewards you'd be selling your RPC endpoints that you're already running anyway um and you'd also effectively be getting rewards from the staking pools as well okay and the last agent spotlight that I want to share with you today came from Shawn Brennan of Bio Protocol in his spotlight Shawn introduces this idea of a bio agent these are scientific AI agents that could help researchers generate hypotheses test their experiments and then summarize the results of those experiments moving on to agents this is a first look at bioagents which are meant to accelerate the speed of science here's a a quote from Sam Alman we expect the impact of AGI to be uneven although some industry will change a little scientific progress will likely be much faster than today this impact will surpass everything else so if we're preparing for this world really the as we hit a plateau of applying compute to new models what's the next best thing we we always want more and more intelligent models but we think this will improve the world so after that plateaus what is the next best best thing to put that compute towards and I would posit that it's probably towards running agents that are continuously thinking about science continuously thinking about the next best thing uh widening uh the dark areas of the scientific tech tree and we are putting in the steps now to create a decentralized distributed fleet of 1 million bioagents by the end of the year we think we can do this on parallel so in his spotlight Sean draws a parallel between these bioagents and Google DeepMind's AlphaFold project where 2 million people donated their compute to help map how proteins fold and that should get you pretty excited i mean just imagine if this same energy could be channeled into open-source co-own AI agents for science this could be really powerful sean also mentions in his talk that he thinks it's totally possible to meet and even surpass this 2 million number set by the DeepMind project by running these agents through the decentralized distributed model of uh Pearl the agent app store so I want to wrap up the show by looking at maybe some of the themes that I think emerged across the different talks and presentations one would be a little bit of skepticism about these areas that have been maybe overhyped or overemphasized and the second would be excitement about the places where real AI agents are actually being developed we heard about some real and novel use cases like AI agents for science managing the real world like energy consumption different ways for AI agents to pay each other and exchange services and also some more approachable ideas like uh DeFi agents that manage your portfolio on your behalf autonomous AI agents are also creating and managing infrastructure in new and exciting ways like the validation station and across the board I would say that autonomy seems to be the most important uh determining factor in whether an AI agent actually does what it says it can do from an investor perspective I would say again yeah there's a shift towards these autonomous agents that can run themselves make their own decisions and don't require human oversight which by the way is exactly what OLS agents uh do and have always been designed to do all right bringing it all to a close I would say that this is the most exciting time to be working in the AI agent space certainly for me it is we are finally seeing like real momentum and real problems getting solved and real infrastructure is being built which I think is really great the other thing I would say is we're just getting started this is really the beginning and a lot of really big things are definitely coming soon and that by the way would include the next Agents Unleashed event which I can't say too much about but is coming soon so definitely watch this space as far as this show goes this will be coming out on a regular basis and so maybe now is a good time to give you a preview of the next episode we're going to be taking a 30,000 foot view really zooming out and looking at the current state of autonomous AI agents how autonomous are they and maybe comparing where we are now to where we were six months a year ago and from there we'll be able to extrapolate where we might be going in the future as an aside if you're curious about agentic AI autonomous AI agents I really want to encourage you to try running these agents for yourself there are easy ways to do that like Pearl for example you can check that out at ol.network/operates where there's a lot of really useful information that can get you started today i'd also want to encourage developers and builders of autonomous AI agents to check out etwork as well there's a wealth of information including documentation to help you get started okay so we'll leave it here i want to thank you for listening and invite you to subscribe to the show share it with your friends family colleagues anyone you think might find the show and the future topics that we're going to cover interesting i'd also like to hear from you if there are topics that you think we should cover people that you'd like to hear interviewed or any ideas that you have for the future of the show please get in touch you can send me an email i'm thomasie.xyz XYZ or you could also contact me on X where I'm at Thomas Maybryer all right that's a wrap for the first episode of the Agents Unleashed podcast once again thank you for listening and I'll see you next time [Music]",
