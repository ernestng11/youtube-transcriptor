Thomas Maybrer and I'm the digital media producer for Valerie one of the core contributors to Olas if you haven't heard of or you haven't heard of Agents Unleash before we start the show I'll tell you quickly a little bit about both so is the best way for anyone to own and monetize their AI agent and that includes people just like you you can learn more about how to do that at olas.network and agents unleashed isn't just a podcast it's also the premier event series for people interested in Agentic AI events have been held all over the world with over 77 speakers and presenters and more than 2500 in-person attendees the next event has recently been announced it'll be held June 30th in Can to find out more about the event including how to RSVP you can head to the link in the show notes or the description box if you're watching on YouTube on today's show I'm joined by David Adman who is the head of web 3 investments at M31 Capital david brings a sharp and focused investors perspective shaped by years in traditional finance and infrastructure in this conversation we talk about what makes AI agents more powerful on Web 3 Rails from verifiable privacy to a more composable internet and what most of web 2 still doesn't realize about the edge Web 3 provides i had a great time talking to David and I definitely learned a lot i'm sure you will too so without further ado here's my conversation with David Adman okay yeah um please introduce yourself so give me your name like what are you working on i'm David Adman i'm head of web3 investments at M31 Capital i run both the liquid and illquid investment strategies focused on a lot on infrastructure and so naturally you know have been in and around the AI space for a while and you know given how broad the the use cases of the technology are you know it's been kind of the key aspect of most of the uh new investments we look at um should I go into my background yeah though that's actually my next question is like about your background and yeah um how do you think what you were doing before informs the how you approach what you're doing now yeah so I started my career in traditional finance i spent a decade crossbanking private equity hedge fund um type roles focused on the web 2 networking infrastructure sector and so it's through that lens that I actually got interested in Bitcoin and and blockchain um initially in 2014 saw it as uh disruptive technology to data networking and kind of you know understood the the the difference and the uh advantages of these decentralized networks and what you could build on top of them and and how they would be unique and valuable versus you know the legacy systems that I had been covering and so um you know kind of followed along invested uh on my own didn't go full-time into the industry until early 2021 i launched Omni Chain Capital which was a liquid token fund focused on infrastructure and middleware protocols and uh ran that for three years and was looking for for scale and so ended up merging with M31 at the end of 2023 and have kind of taken over the liquid fund covering web 3 as well as leading the the venture efforts which given my my focus has been mainly web 3 AI some infrastructure and uh and the like so you know I do both both liquid and illquid very hands-on very synergistic within the portfolio and yeah I've been here for a year and a half it's been great cool so you mentioned seeing the advantages of the blockchain approach like what were those advantages then and what are they now have they changed over the past couple of years i think they've gotten more defined for the longest time I kind of you know you look at you look at DeFi and it completely changed what what's possible with finance and I kind of saw the same thing for um you know the rest of the internet the rest of data networking composable compute composable data and I you know I couldn't it was very hard to articulate but kind of having novel functionality that was obviously really valuable with financial assets with DeFi and you know kind of the I hate the term but but opening up the design space in terms of what you could build for for applications for software for how networking works and then there you know there's always the the security piece centralized systems are extremely insecure um and it it all stems generally from a single point of failure and so there are we spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on cyber security you know there's always a breakthrough on you know firewalls and you know ways to manage access and yet every day there's a huge breach into a huge valuable database social security information in the US United Healthcare AT&T Coinbase obviously most recently the US government has been hacked i think China is has access and is allegedly waiting within our infrastructure to attack and so you know the most vital kind of pieces of the government and and our you know national infrastructure are kind of obsolete and just structurally insecure and so having data be accessed by private key and having you know you can still obviously you know put a gun to my head and take my private key and you can take my data but you can't take everyone else's and so I always thought that made sense as someone who covered cyber security it was like why are we spending all this money it doesn't work you know people find ways around and it's because of the um you know the the the structural the way it's built and access the single point of failure that it did you know it didn't matter what you kind of built on top of it you kind of had to restructure it and so you know that that was kind of the overall uh theme and it became I think a lot more clear um with with the introduction of AI agents actually you know I had been very focused on ZK co-process co-processing in general accessing off-chain resources verifying them and bringing them onchain kind of you know beefing up your kind of putting your your smart contracts on um on steroids And you know no one really understood why you'd want to verify an inference you know that people would tell me all the time i go on chat GBT I get an answer i don't really care i don't really care to verify it and that that's completely missing the point and it became clear when you had autonomous agents um you know the first kind of generation they didn't do much but they were kind of fun chat bots on on Twitter that you know were pretty pretty funny pretty knowledgeable sometimes and then they started to kind of acquire financial assets and have their own wallet and then the question became okay is there is it actually autonomous or is there a dev behind it you know coming up with the with with what they're saying or you know intervening and then do they have access to the wallet and so it kind of clicked for people why you need to verify that it's actually you know a closed system private you know the first iteration is really verified through tees and so you get you know confidentiality you get security and you can verify that onchain and so it kind of clicked for people um you know why it's necessary why these different um pieces of you know offchain infrastructure onchain with the wallet that composability uh you know people started to kind of and I started to kind of think of what was possible uh building on top of those kind of themes and so um you know I think the the composability aspect and the security aspect have stayed kind of the the general advantages of web 3 but you know now that we have actual use cases examples tangible you know tangible technology that people can you know understand uh it's become a lot more clear the value not not 100% clear yet unfortunately but you know the the uh the knowledge of of the market is definitely perked up to you know why you would need web 3 or blockchain orchestrated networking yeah I think that very much rhymes with the approach and attitude that Valerie has always had about it and especially recently when LLMs became like I wouldn't say they're commodities yet but in my opinion that's the direction that we're trending in if you think through as you said some of the design spaces it becomes obvious that having an ownership layer of the value could be potentially maybe more valuable than the model below it and how do you how do you give the ownership to the person running the agent and then also as you're saying like verify that the agent does what it says it does i mean we always say trust minimize not trustless um because you give the agent a safe and then a smart account and the agent is able to act on your behalf and then as you said you have this like transparency layer you can go and see what it does but when you interact with AI in um uh from the more centralized players like when I was comparing um some of the first round of trendy AI agents in web 3 on an earlier episode I mentioned and I think this is what you wrote talking about I think it was truth terminal when it first started like really popping off there was this question about you know how autonomous is the generation of the written content but I think that's all just like growing pains of like figuring out where these agents um work because in my opinion and I think this is kind of the Valerie position as well the most useful AI agent is one that you rarely interact with it knows what it's meant to do for you and it's you don't have to put as much trust in it um it just delivers outcomes to you whether that's an outcome to you as the end user or as a developer or as a project launching an entire economy of it like the chat model where you're going back and forth and you do have these questions about where does this output come from that's all interesting but like the ownership layer like you can do something really really interesting in between those two ends wonder if you've thought about it if any of us no yeah um it's actually I was going to interrupt you but I'm glad that I let you finish because um I always say the value of AI is is or AI is only as valuable as the context and kind of access that you give it right so you know a chatbot is cool but you know one that is monitoring my health care you know or my vitals my health care history knows what I'm eating and can you know well a like monitor you know maybe my my body you know get identify something before it becomes serious give me you know um insight into you know how how I should be eating how I should be you know sleeping all that stuff you know doing something on be my be behalf they will need access to my identification will need access to my financial assets if I wanted to you know build something or buy something or or do most things especially in web 3 where you need gas you know uh the the key advantage in my opinion of web 3 AI over web 2 AI is that you have you give agents a lot more autonomy and what I mean by that is you know um as you know all the issues with web two kind of network architecture you know you you can plug in an agent you know with APIs into into most things i think you get you can get an MCP server that has you know hundreds of API plugins but with and it's you know there there's there's access but there's there's not really autonomy because you still need to be uh telling it where what to do and um you know uh you need to give access to you know if it's stripe you need to give access you need to have a um KYC and and all this stuff but you know on web 3 rails you know the the buzzwords permissionlessness and trustlessness which aren't words but we use you know they were kind of ideologies and now it's kind of prerequisite for autonomy within web 3 within AI agents right so taking a step back you know web 2 is like human native whereas web 3 is agent or software native and so you know APIs are set up by humans and companies and and and all that whereas in web 3 the the APIs are the connections between different you know my agent and buying data from Demo or GPUs from you know Ionet or you know bandwidth or you know all of these deep products which are basically tokenized resources you know they could the the agent can basically I give it a prompt kind of like an intent um I give it I say here's $5,000 uh you know make me 50 grand and it can you know obviously search the internet figure out um do its own analysis figure out what to do but then it can act on it right it can it can uh can have its own wallet it can pay for generative video from Live Pier take that and you know maybe maybe some IP from Sonium and you know make a movie that it can sell receive the proceeds and then send it back to me all I have no idea what it's doing and so the human interaction or or need to kind of interfere or intervene is minimized with web 3 rails where it just gives the agent I don't want to say agency cuz um but but more more autonomy than it could ever have in web 2 and it you know theoretically can do it securely and privately you know if systems are are kind of designed correctly in which you can verify and so you know I'm confident that it's not stealing my five grand because I can you know kind of monitor it and um I know how it's set up and all that and so it really opens up what the the freedom I guess of AI agents which maximizes what the value that they can bring their owner or partner you know whatever we want to call them yeah right because I something that I think maybe it's not unique to web 3 but that web 3 does really well is the game theory of different interactions like in a well- setup system all of the different actors are incentivized to provide accurate and true information rather than like you know like you think through all of these loopholes and you build the architecture around getting all of the incentives right and so you can have you can minimize trust in that way and that's something that I think is if not unique uh definitely a strength of web 3 and I think that's kind of what I'm hearing no yeah definitely you know there there are many ways to uh to to set it up right you can have economic incentives you can have um staking with you know you could have uh consensus with you know four even though it's expensive with like four uh different GPUs and that kind of lowers the probability and and the co it increases the cost of um you know doing something malicious and then with you know ZK FH and and these cryptographic type measures which are ultimately backed by some sort of economic security but you know it there are ways to set it up and um yeah it's all game theory uh but which is which is why trust minimize is the right term because you can never eliminate uh risk completely but you can you can be 99.9% certain again if you if you if it's designed well so it it's not you know most hacks that hacks that you see in like DeFi it's it's because of a bad design or or a bug in the code it's not like an inherent and especially in TE which which is a real misconception of its security it's it's how you design it just like anything else you know you slap a TE on something it's not good to go it's like it's a tool to create a system that is verifiable and private and so um yeah agree a lot of ways to which makes it interesting and harder and all that but it opens up the amount of stuff you can do because you can connect to a lot more things yeah maybe that's a good way for my audience is some some somewhat um I wouldn't say non-technical but sometimes we can get a little lost in the weeds those of us who work on this every day and as you were speaking I thought maybe a maybe a good analogy for this is like if you're hiring a contractor to put a fence around your house they can have all of the correct components but if they install the latch on the outside you have all of the right things but you needed to think through the design a little bit right it's not the fence yeah it's it's how you think about the implementation details I guess always um exactly i'm curious about like uh when would you say AI entered your daily life and where do you find the most utility in it like today so I assume you're referring to like you know the chatbt generative AI era right it could be anything you know well let's go with that you know because a lot of things are technically AI and get into the technicalities and all that but um you know I think like date like daily it wasn't until probably like two months ago that I I actually relied on started to rely on like catchbity for all of my my productivity kind of activities it it I don't I don't know which upgrade I don't remember which upgrade was but it got to it got good enough that it was actually useful i remember you know trying to use it for investment memos or emails and it just wasn't it wasn't there it you know it was helpful for some things but not many and and I think about two months ago I really started to use it every day and now I can't really live without it which is pretty crazy and you know what do I use it mostly for you know a lot on um kind of document generation you know at this point it is pretty good at creating at least you know 90% of an investment memo you know uh which is extremely helpful obviously helpful in it's really good at actually developing a technical product roadmap which is which is interesting and kind of the steps and implementation because there's a lot you have to think about at once right how everything fits together what the timing should be how you should um you know test it and the you know all of that and it processes that very quickly and so that's been very helpful it's also very good at obviously like summarizing ing you know a lot of data and information uh at once and so you know creating I love giving it you know 10 white papers and telling me to make a you know competitive landscape something that would have taken me probably a week or longer to make it just does it so I I think of it as you know like Excel but for language and ideas and just um you know think about the relationships and you know producing written language automatically like Excel produces you know um mathematical equations automatically yeah my usage is is quite similar to that my timetable is longer but I would say I would agree that maybe in the last maybe 3 months when I started to get more alternatives like I do use um OpenAI's models quite a bit but recently I've been using many like deep sea I find the Gemini models really useful and like I'm curious what you think about like promise like I find that it's not great at coming up with interesting angles for creative work so what about you like what's an area where you see promise but it's not it's not hitting for you right uh just yet you know I I will admit I have a I have a Substack i've tried to use it for for Substack um pretty pretty busy and and a lot going on and and it's just not it just doesn't work unfortunately and I think it's the way I think of it at least today it's more of a tool than a like a replacement for for something and so um you know maybe uh you know definitely if I'm doing a substack about you know a protocol or or an industry the competitive landscape and all that definitely can can use chat GBT for that but you know it still can't you I could feed it all my substacks it's still not good at at um or at least in my opinion at like mimicking my my tone and style and then yeah it's just not like fun to read so I definitely agree on the creative side it's not there yet but as I said it's more of a tool that you're doing again it's just like human intervening it's not really autonomous yet um and where where it uh you know what I what I try to you know I'm not a an engineer but obviously there's a lot of no code um or low code uh tools out there but you know what I'm focused on is like workflow automation and having everything kind of everything that I use all my productivity tools kind of connected and uh in sync having kind of like a universal view of of my kind of profession professional life and this is actually one of my portfolio companies sent Centiggen is building this where you have you know it's not it's it's it's one thing to like integrate with as I said with these MCP offthe-shelf uh products but actually having an overall view to to say hey based on your conversation from last month this chat you know this group chat that you archived uh because it was annoying you on telegram and you know this trend that I'm noticing on Twitter like you should really take a look at this narrative something that I would have never looked at and and maybe like autogenerate a report on it and say \"Hey do you want to send this out to your LPs?\" Like you know as something that you're looking at and having everything kind of read and write but also just the full context and then the ability to kind of come up with ideas you know not not me prompting it just it it knows what it knows the ultimate goal which is you know outperform and grow AUM and then it figures out all the all the uh details in between that and can really uh you know automate these workflows and so obviously we're not there yet but this is the vision of Centroen it's kind of an autonomous business obviously there will always be an owner if I'm not doing something at least I own the system that that's making money but I I absolutely see that as the future is it is it next year or 3 years like I'm not sure probably I'll go with under 3 years but yeah it's kind of these step-by-step by-step processes and then unprompted kind of just understanding the situation understanding your whole knowledge base and coming up with ideas that you would have never thought of yeah I think right now you can you can kind of approximate something close to that by building custom versions of things like a custo but the problem with that you have to like I have a couple that I use for different purposes and I'm always uploading PDFs of like okay here's the here's the new you know here's the new spreadsheet with all the latest numbers and if you forget that you haven't done that it's still good but it's lacking this context so I think maybe where we might go next is being able to as you say like absorb that on its on and also I really liked what you said about looking at things that maybe you as the end user would have overlooked and bringing them to your attention getting that right of course will be really really important because I I think from a UX perspective the first time that it brings you something that's irrelevant you're going to turn it off and say \"Don't recommend me you know and then then your end user is not going to get that that value as it improves later.\" Or even come back to me and say \"Hey like you know no one cares about outperformance uh you know you should be focused more on marketing you should change what your goal is that you told me to to achieve and here's why and I'll be like \"Oh.\" And unfortunately that's there's there's a little bit of truth to that but um but yeah no it's it's it's really becoming this autonomous like not independent well independent but um you know separate entity that that can uh supplement but also just like become a completely new source of I I was talking to um a developer last night who uh is developing um software for investment funds and you know he was surprised to see yes it's it's automation of workflow that we do today but It's also I would do a you know X Y and Z if I had the technical capabilities or time or whatever it is and so it's like automating stuff you do today but then ability to do more things that you would have never been able to do so it's you know additional kind of uh productivity yeah that's very much my experience of being augmented by these tools like there are things that I know just enough to be dangerous you know like I'm I feel very fortunate that I live in the timeline where like I'm never gonna have to learn to write good bash scripts i can use them all the time which now I do but like if I think back to maybe like five or six years ago like I was writing bad scripts like and I would get into like trying to learn it and I think I just don't have the time for this i'm not getting paid to you know to learn scripting now I don't have to so I think we're going to see more and more of that like augmentation where you don't have to pick up necessarily every skill you do need to be able to think through design like with at least a little bit of clarity but yeah even as it even as they get better like hopefully they'll start to maybe if we find a way to have them be useful assistants but without this like overagreement problem that you know that they have always had yeah there's there's probably some really interesting spaces in there and that so that reminds me of like uh the narrative that you know um developers are are obsolete and that you know because anyone's a developer and I think it's like anything else it's like it's it it augments you so a good developer will become you know three times as good and you know maybe a bad developer will become you know a baseline developer it's like I'll bring it back to the Excel um background example but if I'm a really good you know they used to they used to um model on like on paper with graph paper and and all that stuff and and if you're really good at that you're probably going to be really good at Excel too because you know all the concepts you know it needs to be done but you could just do 10 times more right with this automation and if you're bad at modeling like maybe Excel will help but like still like it you know you need to know how it can help you to for it to be you know valuable so I I think there's a I I hate that narrative that like developers will go obsolete i think just like anything if you don't use it you're at a disadvantage so that's the main thing but you know still if you're if you're talented and and you know ambitious or whatever um you can never kind of uh you can never replace that yeah definitely i I completely agree with you there like it's so this is the most the most important time to learn how to do this was like yesterday second best is today great i haven't asked at all about uh how you're looking at the space like from an investor perspective like I think it might be interesting for my audience to hear from an investor you have a more 30,000 foot view of the space like what are you seeing and what do you think that those of us who are just kind of consumers like what do you think we should know that you're seeing that maybe hasn't trickled down yet that's an interesting question i um in terms of you know the first part of the question you know what we kind of look for from an investment standpoint you know I said my background is in infrastructure I've we've built a you know kind of full we've curated a full stack um you know infrastructure portfolio and you know the if you build it they will come like hasn't worked in web 3 I think it's pretty pretty obvious at this point and so you know what we've been seeking out is okay uh you know web 2 AI is demanded is uh you know real businesses that have you know have revenue and and they would love to save 80% on on inference costs right it's their biggest um overhead and so you know it it's kind of like taking you know the the really valuable and unique web 3 infrastructure today and applying it to stuff that already exists and so lowering costs and so we've started to actually dip our toes into you know non blockchain native i hope my my uh hope is in two years we don't say web two web 3 we just say AI um but it's really like you know taking something either making it cheaper and more scalable or you know something like facial recognition or healthcare data uh AI is it's really tricky with all the regulations and all the siloed um systems but you know with uh with web 3 rails with with verifiable um guaranteed like privacy and security and custody over that data you can do a lot more and so it's kind of augmenting these uh you know more traditional or you know non-web3 three businesses with this web 3 tech and so you know that's what we've been thinking about that's what we look for uh in terms of you know upside um rather than kind of oh this is cool like hopefully someone will build on it uh that's just like it hasn't worked and I don't think it's a good we've seen plenty of projects just run out of time right you got to find something today and maybe that is something in in you know three five years down the line but you need to find kind of uh effective solutions uh today for the technology and in terms of the trickle down I think so okay I I think a couple things um and I think it's good that the end user won't actually know that uh that that this is happening but I think that most people would be surprised to See so you have two things you have um you have real actual adoption and traction from web 3 AI infrastructure companies in web 2 um you know I think people people know the GPU stuff but uh which is extremely early days um but on the on the security and privacy you know one one of our I'll shill my shill my bag i got it uh one of our portfolio companies Super Protocol which is a you know TE based uh cloud um infrastructure provider has found insane product market fit with healthcare data companies with any web 2 AI company that needs to that needs to compute over sensitive data um which you can't really do you can't do from the public cloud uh and then and so you see like companies that don't care about decentralization crypto probably have a negative view if anything on it but they just care about they can only get that functionality from these blockchain orchestrated systems and that's real and uh and already live today and and only going to be uh become the norm I think and the reason I think that is because you look at the web two side of things you Apple with their Apple intelligence uh you know all of the compute can't happen on device some of it can but not all of it and as as we progress we'll get better and better models and um and anyway there's always going to be a need to offload compute and at their intelligence uh announcement they said we can't do this in the cloud the public cloud is a non-starter and so they built their own cloud it it looks exactly like a blockchain orchestrated network it's te based uh their private keys all that stuff and the only difference is and they call it like a you know a um I don't know they call it like a public ledger something like that and I thought it was blockchain where they store the keys and and they have the kind of uh transparency into into everything that's happening so you can make sure that your data is safe and all that and that the computations are happening as as planned but they own and operate that ledger and so they're like almost there but um but uh you can see the design uh is is exactly what web3i is they just need to get to the public blockchain aspect um and then you know you see uh you know uh Google Google wallet I think is implementing ZK technology again not to be posted on a blockchain yet but you kind of you see it starting to happen visa with their AI agent uh platform uh the identity I think I forgot what they call it tokenized passport for the um so it's like tokenized identity again not on public chain uh but so you see both sides kind of converging and I think it for for me it's been obvious for for a long time but it's always nice to see it actually happening and so um I think people be will be should be and will be surprised at how uh how prevalent web web 2 AI will be leveraging blockchain technology cool yeah as a complement to existing systems to improve them rather than maybe like a few years ago more people expected the total replacement of like a um the old solution although if something if something uses you know if a company uses super protocol does it become web 3 so you know maybe it's just a definition but um but yeah I think you know it it converges and you know maybe the infrastructure gets displaced but you know I think the upper part of the stack can live in harmony with cool great answer um so I think we'll wrap it up here is there anything that you really want um to mention or something that you think is important we didn't touch on no I mean one one of my you know this is a AI focused crowd one of my you know um main initiatives uh more recently has been you know penetrating web 2 ai and getting like a consortium of I think we're stronger in numbers right we're we're still a pretty small industry even though we're you know very um tribal but you know if anyone out there is is also thinking about you know getting um distribution into web 2 whether it's you know through VARS through system integrators through consultants or you know accelerators all that stuff you know would love to kind of uh team up i think you know there there's only so much you know a single team can do but as I said I think there's strength in numbers and uh you know I think it'll be very important there's a huge need for the cost savings the security the privacy and web 2 has no idea this exists everyone I talk to they're like really and so um you know anyone like kind of thinking about that effort please reach out yeah let's bridge that gap all right David it's been really interesting
