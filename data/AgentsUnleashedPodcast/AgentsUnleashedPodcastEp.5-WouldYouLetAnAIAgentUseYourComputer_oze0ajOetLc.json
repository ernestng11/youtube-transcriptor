  "description": "This is episode five of the Agents Unleashed podcast â€” your guide to filtering the signal from the noise in the fast-evolving world of agentic AI.\n\nIn this episode, host Thomas Maybrier goes hands-on with some of the newest demos in the agentic AI space, including the Open Computer project from Smol Agents, which combines Qwen2, a Linux sandbox, and Python-based agent reasoning. He shares his firsthand experience with the demo, the UX tradeoffs, and the broader questions raised by giving AI agents access to your computer or desktop.\n\nThe episode also explores how companies like Microsoft and Google are bringing agentic behavior to the mainstream. Microsoft is embedding AI agents directly into Windows via Copilot Vision, while Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro is showing off powerful multimodal capabilities, including the ability to generate learning apps from YouTube videos.\n\nThis episode covers questions of privacy, control, and ownership. If agents are watching our screens and reading our files, who benefits? And how can users share in the upside of the AI economy? \n\nThomas offers one possible path forward: agentic economies like Olas, where open-source agents and incentivized staking models shift the power dynamic back to the user.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:02 Overview of today's AI agent demonstrations\n01:53 SmolAgents demo and Open Computer explanation\n05:24 Privacy concerns with desktop AI agents\n05:53 Microsoft's integration of agents into Windows\n06:56 Copilot Vision and desktop integration challenges\n08:30 Google's progress with multimodal models\n09:30 Gemini's video analysis capabilities\n10:01 Discussion of data ownership and open-source approach\n10:59 Closing thoughts and future of agentic AI\n\n\nResources mentioned in this episode:\n\nSmolAgents Open Computer demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/smolagents/computer-agent\n\nQwen2 from Alibaba: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct\n\nE2B Linux sandbox: https://github.com/e2b-dev/desktop\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Vision: https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/12/copilot-on-windows-windows-insiders-can-now-use-vision-with-2-apps-and-new-highlights-feature-with-1-app/\n\nGoogle Gemini Pro + Flash Overview: https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-video-understanding/\n\nðŸ”” Donâ€™t forget:\nAgents Unleashed is also a global event series on agentic AI â€” the next event is June 30th in Cannes, France.

AI i'm your host Thomas Maybar and I'm the digital media producer for Valerie one of the core contributors to OLS and if you haven't heard of OIS or you haven't heard of Agents Unleashed let me quickly tell you a little bit about both so Ols makes it easy for anyone to own and monetize an AI agent and that includes people like you to learn more about how you can do that you can head to olas.network and Agents Unleashed isn't just a podcast it's also the premier event series for people interested in AI agents gatherings have been held all over the world and there's been over 75 speakers and presenters and more than 2500 in-person attendees the next Agents Unleashed event has recently been announced it'll be held June 30th in Ken in France if previous events are anything to go by it's going to be great so you're going to want to lock in an RSVP now you can do that through the link that you'll find in the show notes or the description box if you're watching on YouTube hope to see you there okay so on today's show I want to share some in production agentic AI demos some promising advances that could enable more agents like them and some thoughts about where we might be headed okay so let's start with something fresh from the team behind small agents if you're not familiar with small agents it's a library that allows Python agents to think in code they've set up a demo called Open Computer that's comprised of three parts it's got the small agent library Alibaba's Quen 2 model that it uses for reasoning and a sandbox Linux virtual computer hosted by E2B put together these components let you assign an AI agent a task and then it can use the computer to attempt to complete that task i was actually able to try this out for myself and I've got some footage so I'm going to put that up on screen for those of you watching on YouTube or Spotify so like I said I had some mixed results so let's talk about them so first there is a Q this is a space that's provided by the small agents team so if you want to use it and there are other people who want to use it you have to get into a queue now the first time I tried it the queue was anywhere from 8 to 30 people long and I didn't really get much success one time the agent did get into a workflow but got stuck on a capture and I didn't have it up on screen so I wasn't able to proceed so what I did with the agent is I asked it to find me a cheap holiday destination in Italy with beach access and yeah like I said mixed results what happened was the agent took my prompt turned it into text and then attempted to do a Google search with that so it opened the browser it navigated into the search bar it pasted in my query but as soon as we hit Google we ran into a caption now what the small agents team suggests to do here is pause the agent and solve the capture for it now the first time I wasn't watching the screen so I didn't get to this step and the agent just kept attempting to solve the capture and then we ran out of time something there was some kind of error and it stopped working this morning when I tried it again I did get to the capture i stopped the agent and then as you'll see if you're watching on screen I solved a few captas and then eventually the space stopped responding to my clicks so unfortunately I was never able to see what this agent can do and I'm going to have to choose my own holiday destination this year so yeah this was frustrating but that's how these demos sometimes go what is cool here though is the approach and I was able to see the results of other people trying out this agent so what this demo does they're combining open- source tooling in a way that lets the AI see the desktop this isn't the fastest way to build an agentic AI by any means using APIs and more traditional programming patterns would obviously be much faster but maybe this clicking through the user interface behavior appeals to some users and maybe there's going to be space for that as we see AI agents like mature and take new forms it's worth pointing out that there's always going to be ideas that people have that are not easily accessible through a traditional programming path not everybody has that ability or necessarily wants to do it but as I saw with uh the demo like the web is not set up for AI agents to be used in this way like the capture problem just completely stopped the agent from functioning for me now this is just a demo but there are some other agents like it on the market and there's some important differences that I will point out chatgbt has an operator function it costs $200 with the ChatgBT Pro subscription but it does give you access to operator an operator uses the browser similar to the way that the Open Computer Agent eventually attempted to do when it tried to complete my task there's also some open-source alternatives there's an extension called Browser Use that does require some technical knowhow i haven't tried it it's cheaper it's $30 a month but yeah one big difference between operator and uh browser use and open computer is that open computer is running in a sandboxed environment in the cloud it's not your computer now that's great for privacy of course but to build a truly useful computer use agent that's clicking around through a UI like this you're going to want it to have access to your machine but that's going to come with some serious privacy trade-offs obviously in most cases if you've got an agent like this looking at your computer it's taking a screen touch of your desktop of anything that's open and most likely sending that to a centralized LM provider where you completely lose control of it not only do you lose control but you don't even know what is being done with it and that should definitely give you pause it's a relatively big ask for a honestly unproven value proposition a demo like this does show that it is possible to run powerful AI agents in the cloud that's very cool we may see more of that in certain use cases perhaps there's undiscovered utility there but again there's open questions who captures the value if we bring this to the user's desktop how do we protect their privacy how do we communicate the trade-offs so on and so forth it's definitely a messy area with some interesting UX challenges to be solved that takes us to Microsoft now who have also made some announcements around agentic AI they've made it clear recently that they see agents as a core Windows feature and so it wasn't surprising that at their recent build conference they announced some new agentic features one that I found particularly interesting is this idea of an agent that you use to adjust the settings on your computer by giving it direct access to the settings menu there's also co-pilot vision which is a way to allow their co-pilot assistant to see the contents of your desktop this feature is already available to Windows insiders and it's also on mobile i think this is the most direct implementation of agentic behavior on a consumer desktop that we've seen so far and I personally do expect to see more of this this type of behavior brings us right back to the earlier concerns that I outlined about having an AI agent have access to your desktop your personal computer unless Microsoft is running Copilot Vision entirely on device presumably not only screenshots but personally identifiable information sensitive metadata is all being sent to their servers where again you're losing control of it from a privacy standpoint it's a black box not only do you not know how your data is used but you don't even know where it's going and you certainly don't have any control over it if AI agents are going to become this tightly embedded into our personal computing context I'd say that we need really clear guarantees around transparency and the security of our data i am curious to see how people respond to this kind of agentic behavior will they embrace it do they have concerns do they find it useful oh yeah all of this remains to be seen it's also worth asking why people are excited about this type of angic behavior in the first place it's definitely interesting but I personally don't see this as the dominant paradigm for agentic computing going forward i suspect that as agentic AI behavior becomes more mainstream every platform and system will support it natively you're not going to need to simulate the user clicking through the interface because the system can expose the same functionality directly through an agentfriendly layer in the future this type of screenshot based computer use agent may have some niche applications for a very particular type of user or for edge cases where APIs don't and won't ever exist but as a general purpose approach to AI agents I don't think this is it earlier I mentioned OpenAI's operator which works in the same way where the AI agent controls the browser yashkumar one of OpenAI's engineers who worked on the operator team said this about it quote \"We're starting with the browser because this is where the majority of work happens.\" He also said \"The ability to use the same interfaces and tools that humans interact with on a daily basis broadens the utility of AI helping people save time on everyday tasks.\" End quote so there's another perspective we may see these uh computer use agents stick around for a while but it's all going to depend on where the time and energy goes and what people actually find useful okay so moving on I want to talk a little bit about Google they've made some real progress with multimodal models recently in particular the Gemini Pro and Gemini Flash models these are multimodals that are designed to handle audio text video and they have the ability to write and execute code one of my favorite things that they have demoed recently using the Gemini Pro model is a simple but powerful idea what they do in the demo is give Gemini a YouTube URL and a prompt the model then analyzes the video writes a spec for a learning application that spec is then turned into code which is then used to generate a learning application to help walk you through the concepts and ideas in the video in the example from their blog post they watch a video about eyeglasses and generate a quiz where you match the type of lens to the type of vision correction that's needed it's very cool and what gives it an edge is the ability to look at what's on screen and then combine that with the text transcript of the video many AI models can already do this but Gemini is particularly good at it apparently it can analyze up to 6 hours of video content in this way if you imagine pairing a highly functional model like this with small agents open computer demo it's not hard to imagine very powerful agentic AI use cases maybe just demos of proof of concepts but yeah I'd love to see what people can do with this tech all of these demos do raise a big point that I want to get you thinking about if you've got an AI agent watching your screen or looking at your files who owns that experience are you just helping to build another cloud product with your data not being compensated for it are you potentially exposing sensitive personal information is there any way to take part in the upside i think this is where the OS approach to AI agents really shines every agent in the OS ecosystem is by definition open source and the protocol includes what I sometimes describe as an incentivization layer called proof of active agent staking this is a mechanism that developers can leverage to get people to run their agent and the operators who run those agents to be compensated for doing so this means that the more helpful the tool the more people can benefit from it and you get this compounding effect where instead of having an AI agent running in isolation you're actually building an agentic economy that can produce outcomes of its own and that's the direction that I want to leave you with today the building blocks are obviously here we've got open source libraries like small agents multimodal models like Gemini are making serious progress userfacing agentic AI is coming to the desktop with Microsoft Copilot Vision these tools are probably early they're going to be imperfect but they're going to be foundational particularly in communicating the power and promise of agentic AI to everyday users before we go I want to throw it to you would you use an AI agent like this would you let one control your computer see your desktop have you tried the small agents demo what happened did it work for you and I'd also like to invite you to leave a comment rate the show and share it with a friend colleague or family member that you think might get something out of it and by the way don't forget to RSVP for the next Agents Unleashed event it's June 30th in Can links to more information about that can be found in the show notes or the description box if you're watching on YouTube all right we'll leave it there for this week this has been the Agents Unleash podcast and I'll see you next time [Music]",
