    "aggregated_text": "in the next uh year in the past year about 26,000 AI startups went live um over 25,000s of them are not going to make it there will be some fairy tale stories but if we're honest most of them are going to be horror stories um these are not real headlines but this is what I read when I see the current tech news it looks like history is repeating itself and we're reliving some aspects of the docom bubble um there's a lot of vision and money coming into our industry right now and it looks like the excitement is causing many companies to put too much weight on their tech and AI branding and too little on their go to market strategy um today I'm going to show you the best of the worst uh and show you the lessons that we learned specifically going to launch our own AI product which is the reason I wanted to see what not to do uh so before we dive in quick context about who we are and what is the product that we're launching that's going to be our case study for today bright data is the world's largest and most popular web data infrastructure for AI we deliver data uh sets and data pipelines for model training for the models to become meaningfully better um and browsing infrastructure for AI agents to be able to do what they need to be doing um on the web at scale without getting blocked about 20,000 20,000 customers uh from the largest LLMs to uh vertical specific AI apps to Aentic AI to traditional companies uh who are going through some AI transformation and need data to power their AI projects that's a lot of data to give you a sense of the scale we deal with text image audio video data in over 70 languages um and every day we deliver enough data for our customers to uh train an LLM from scratch so the product that we're launching we're going to launch in a couple weeks it's called Deep Lookup deep Lookup is a deep research AI engine um designed to take as input very complex queries and to spit out highquality results in up to thousands of records of scale um so you can ask it complex questions like find all the shipping companies that are negatively affected by the reduction in the number of transits throughout the Panama Canal and you'll get a high quality hopefully accurate answer that you can start immediately working with so uh we think it's better than other research tools because of the quality and the accuracy of the results and also the size of the samples that you get which is a meaningful work tool rather than you know what you get from other deep research tools which is kind of feels like a sample this is actually uh not our core business we are an AI infrastructure company we built this product as a showcase product to show our AI customers how easy it is for us to in access the entire public web and get them all the data that they need in scale but we fell in love with it and we think a lot of people are going to be happy with it so we're launching it and going to the launch my team and I we started to look at what not to do and what to avoid in case uh we want to make sure this doesn't become um you know an expensive mess for us so here are some of the lessons that we learned from others mistakes the first lesson comes from a company called Prisma Labs they have a mobile app that transforms photos into artistic styles in November of 22 they introduced a new feature called the magic avatars um magic avatar is is a feature to uh kind of make people's nice uh AI generated portraits it was a paid feature and it went completely viral right you probably seen it at some point on your social media feeds uh they had that year in December about 19 million uh installs a month later it already dropped to 1.4 million installs and in June of that year active users plunged to less than a million so initial revenue numbers were great but this feature was a one-off experience users came into the app and they created their avatar and never came back there was no design for ongoing use no community aspect to it or a meaningful product feature to get people to continuously use it what we call continuous usage um so very good example of a good product market fit and viral growth but very little continuity which you need to run a successful business with deep lookup the lesson that we took here is that we needed to understand what would get users to continuously use the tool before the next research which could take a while right so we gave it to a bunch of alpha users um we stood over their shoulders and we asked them to verbalize what's going on in their minds while they were using it and most importantly asked them what would be the next step that you would want to run with a tool um that you can't do right now this made us realize that when people do research they don't always think about all of the data points that they need at the end result so we built a feature that just does just that right uh that adds a column where you can enrich the data even further in our example if the answers are companies then you can add you know what's the fleet size is it a company uh is it a private or public company um what's the name of the CEO you name it so beta users reacted really well to this it doubled almost double the usage time and retention became really good so actually people started using it all the way up to their next research which is the stickiness that we were going for and we think it's because it became a tool that you iterate with um and not just a transactional tool the next lesson comes from a company you may have heard of Builder AI builder AI marketed itself as an AI powered app development software claiming that its AI assistant Natasha automates the complete app software development cycle um the idea was simple you uh use the tool pick a few features and the AI creates your whole software their main message where they went to market was is that creating software is as easy as ordering pizza because you know everything is AI these days they raised about $450 million from pretty serious investors like Microsoft and Qatar um and Soft Bank uh of with a valuation of about $1.5 billion it was later discovered that there was very little AI in builder AI's uh tech um and actually most of the work was done by about 700 human engineers sitting in India um so these engineers wrote most of the codes and shipped it as if it was AI you can imagine a bunch of lawsuits happened and an official investigation and earlier this year this blew up and from a $ 1.5 billion valuation the company is now in bankruptcy bankruptcy uh proceedings so the lesson for us here was that AI washing is a serious thing at this point in our industry enough users and investors got burned by it so there's a built-in suspicion with any company that calls itself currently an AI company so because for deep lookup the product takes about a few minutes 5 to 20 minutes to get you the results we realized we have to address this concern right so we decided to market this like skeptics not like believers right looked at our ICPS our ideal customer profiles um and asked oursel who is the most critical person in the room that person who's always kind of suspicious thinking about how it's being manipulated uh what's being withheld from him and we market it to that guy right um so this led to product choices like showing the reasoning of the model while it's working and for each data point literally each data point we have a little option that you can see the reasoning that brought that particular data point back all the way with the citations of what the mo why the model decided to take that decision so users can actually sanity check their data and maybe get ideas on the next iteration of their uh research so we're as a matter of strategy trying to be as transparent as possible and to show users what's happening inside of the black box they seem to appreciate it the next lesson comes from a company called Bourdi AI by AAI is an AIdriven networking assistant helping people create meaningful connections on LinkedIn earlier this year they raised about $8 million uh uh seed round um and right after the round they decided to cut through the noise our industry is very dense and to run a funny humorous campaigns to to to get to get out to the public um so they decided to send unsolicited emails to their user base style in the voice of Donald Trump this was around the time of the presidential inauguration in in the United States um so these emails that they sent were supposed to be in the voice of Donald Trump making comments on people's profiles the problem was is that women got comments on their physical appearances with statements like your mouth commands attention and your eyes sparkle um and men got just standard comments on their professionalism and and and skills so users were really um bothered by this and said this is sexist and it's reaffirming of uh bad uh you know gender stereotypes it became really bad online so the CEO issued a a public apology on LinkedIn and even took responsibility but it seems like the damage was done especially harmful for a company that's all about connecting people right um so this this tonedeaf tech thing I get it the the the markets are really crowded every startup wants to be memorable they want to be uh to have a positive sentiment to cut through the noise it's also fun for marketeers to use humor right we love copyrightiting and we love the wittiness but the statistics show that using humor in go to market can be very tricky and the risk is rarely worth the upside what seems to be working best across most a successful AI product launches is clarity over cleverness so we did just that we went for intuitive straightforward non-gimmicky messaging we say clearly what we do without forcing any eccentric personality into this um there could be go to markets where humor is a good idea but it needs to be very carefully examined and executed the next lesson we learned comes from a company called Humane so in 2023 Humane launched the AI pin a wearable device $6.99 with a $24 subscription monthly positioned as a revolutionary device to replace the smartphone you guys remember that uh it had a projector and an AI integration and uh a camera and all the bells and whistles and the launch was massive these guys were everywhere they did TED talks they were even chosen as Times magazine best invention of 2023 uh before the launch though several employees and early stage uh users had many concerns about the product's readiness for market battery issues overheating software bugs company dismissed it there's even reports of a senior engineer that got laid off because he raised the flag that said \"Guys this product is not ready for production.\" But the company went away anyway and launched it in uh April of 24 and you guessed it reviews were far from great people had issues with basically every aspect of the product one popular tech reviewer even called it the worst product I have ever reviewed that can't be good they aimed to launch 10 100,000 units in the first year they only shipped about 10,000 um and in the middle of 24 their product returns exceeded sales so February of this year they announced the discontinuation and they were bought by HP mostly for the patents in terms of the overpromising and underd delivering this could have been tricky for us with deep lookup because it's really easy to oversell a deep research product you can basically promise the world right um and because it's a natural language interface uh the users have the option to ask a bunch of questions that the product was not designed to answer therefore they would might they might get a bad experience so it was important for us to be clear about what this tool can and cannot do but it's a bad experience to keep telling users don't use it for this don't use it for that so we try to approach it from a positive way and across the user flow we're actually giving users examples and inspiration for how they should be using the tool to get the maximum output next version will actually have a prompting co-pilot which will allow users to iterate on the best query that will ensure that the product can help um answer that in a quality way the next lesson comes from a company called Pair AI in September 24 these guys launch an AI powered code editor uh this product was a fork of uh existing open-source projects however pairai released it under a proprietary license and called it the pair enterprise license reportedly even that thing they wrote with with chat GPT um this obviously violated the original Apache license terms and immediately pissed off the open source community which is Tech's one of tech's most active and united community you don't want to piss them off they got even angrier when they realized that Perry AI only made minimal changes to the code base which means they basically rebranded other people's work so the company corrected themselves since then uh but the trust was gone and even Y Combinator that invested in them uh got a bit of criticism because they didn't figure this out in the due diligence process and who knows what the future holds for pair AI for us building trust was not about showing that we didn't steal the code it was about showing that we stand behind what we do so in the past 2 years uh we were sued by both Meta and Twitter for accessing public for accessing public web data that's on their platforms public web data means not behind any login and anybody with a browser can access and unlike many other companies that were sued and immediately folded we decided to stand up for what what we believe in which is that public data should remain public and not be privatized in the hands of some tech conglomerates right um these were pretty high profile cases which we end up winning but what mattered the most to our audience is that we stood up for what we all us and the community collectively believe in so doing things ethically and compliantly made sure that we protect ourselves and the users the next lesson is from a mobile app called Artifact anybody ever heard of Artifact so Artifact was an AI powered news app and it launched in early 2023 uh because the it was founded by Instagram's co-founders it got a lot of attention from the media and apparently the artifact team thought that would be enough so it seems like the marketing for artifact relied mostly on the founders buzz and clout and uh there was very minimal effort to build a you know grassroots movement uh early stage users the community it needs some call this you know going for the media only a top- down approach but the bottom up approach of true fans and people that would become ambassadors early on was not there this app had social elements to it which means it was crucial for this product to have the people on its side but they weren't and just a year later in January of 24 Artifact announced uh it's shutting down due to lack of market opportunity and low user engagement so for Bright Data we've had really good experience over the years with marketing with our users putting our users in the front this means recording tutorials with them doing cool projects doing hackathons we even produced a mini reality show called um the Iron Analyst which was super nerdy and awesome um and we haven't looked back ever since this type of positive sentiment and grassroots movement that you get from marketing with rather than to is the closest thing you can get to uh a movement and uh organic growth so working like this is actually very easy one day I told my team from now on we're going to create 0% of the content ourselves find capable power users that can use the product for their own good have them create the content and figure it out from there and we it it really was a gamecher for us we actually learned about new new use cases that um we never thought of and ways of describing the product that the marketing team hasn't thought of so all in all I would really recommend and the last lesson comes from a company we all know Duolingo so Dualingo is a popular platform for um learning languages in a gamified way they recently expanded to other areas like math and chess um and music but it seems like lately uh Dualingo is doubling down on the concept of AI instead of humans the company did a popular uh not popular but a uh very public layoff round of about 10% of its workforce and declared that all of them are going to be replaced with uh AI and the CEO went out with a series of statements saying that he thinks that uh AI is currently better than human teachers and in the near future schools are going to become glorified day centers so this caused quite a lot of backlash on social media which is the main go-to market channel and acquisition for Dualingo things got bad on social media so bad that they decided to shut down temporarily their Instagram and Tik Tok accounts until the storm passed it looks like they just couldn't handle it um they since put their accounts back on social but we can imagine what type of damage uh they they got at that time so I get it if you're in love with the product and you know very clear the value proposition it could be really tempting to talk about all the things and all the hours and maybe the positions that your AI product can replace and we we have history of tech products growing very quickly and eventually replacing people but while they were growing these tech products that eventually replace people they were not saying they're going to replace people why because it doesn't work it it creates uh it antagonizes people it creates rejection and fear instead of curiosity and adoption which is what you want to go for so we acknowledge that with deep lookup some of the users are going to have anxiety that they're going to be replaced um and that's why our narrative is is the opposite our narrative is that throughout history humans have always created tools to augment their capabilities uh and AI is the latest wave in that evolutionary trend uh and they should adopt it so our messaging is about how to elevate and not how to eliminate and in initial testing it looks like that's the message that works much better than attacking people's wasteful existence so to sum up our time today and our lessons the difference between hype and traction is not your model's performance it's your go to market and you should give it the appropriate weight and ownership there is no shame as you can see in learning from others mistake if you're uh soon going to launch an AI product I wish you good luck and to become a fairy tale story rather than a horror story thank you very much",
