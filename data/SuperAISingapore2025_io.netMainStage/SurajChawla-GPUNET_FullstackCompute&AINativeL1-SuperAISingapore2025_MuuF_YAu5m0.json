    "aggregated_text": "what is GPU net fundamentally like full stack AI and compute native L1 i presume most of you are here for AI Uh but we are also going to talk about how it goes to the future of humanity I am going to talk about leak one um GPUet and about myself in the reverse order So um when I said I'm going to talk about league one you people were like okay and uh I was like look I'm no statesman diplomat historian not even good with finances or in the very great way Singapore is but as an entrepreneur I want to be able to talk about one of the greatest entrepreneurs uh who has ever lived and today we are going to do that Okay And then they were like \"Okay let's do that.\" So I think Andrew gave a very great intro about me but fundamentally I went from physics to AI to crypto to GPUet Um I was really pursuing dark matter which makes up 30% of our universe We have no idea U but what we needed to do back in 2010 when I was doing research was to set up a trillion dollar equipment to go around the sun um to even just know minutely what this dark matter could be and I said it does not make sense at this point Okay if I had those trillion there are much better things to do Um and that's when I started my entrepreneurship journey Uh apparently the clustering algorithm we used it's today called AI that became AI I did my thesis in that and finally money led me to crypto and um there was uh worked with a lot of companies governments um also did a lot of for the Indian defense side of AI uh speech to text back in covid times but somewhere we realized 1D AI is done which is basically chat GPT you know it's only text um then we said 2D generative AI which is all the images that you see in fact the image that we used back here you know very greatly done by midjourney okay and finally I said okay what's remaining so let's do 3D okay 3D is like you imagine a GTA like world you put text and it's just created so that's 3D generative AI we created this but we fell short on GPUs massively like super short like we needed more than not Facebook has or meta has the number of GPUs So we said this is a problem that not just me but probably all the enterprises or all the startups will face and this is very early 2022 So we said okay let me just create a network of GPUs that's what our name was GPU net and keep a target can I reduce the cost of GPU cloud yeah now you go to AWS and you rent uh you get your GPUs but you're paying for the whole setup all the uh services microservices containerization blah blah but if you only want that GPU okay it can be made cheaper okay So the logic is we created an Airbnb of data centers working with really good tier three tier 4 data centers partnered with um NT okay the Japanese conglomerate northern data in Europe G42 in UAE and we built this and we have brought down the cost okay what it means for you at the end of the day is you can get compute which is way cheaper now you wouldn't get it directly for data centers uh from directly from them because they won't care about giving doing 1 GPU 10 GPU for 1 hour or 1 week or 1 month right they are huge capeex businesses Uh but we have done that here You have you must have got like a luggage tag uh in all of you If not you can always take it from me Uh we have given some free compute that you can go and actually try it out Um so let's uh move on to the big part Okay that's that's about GPU net But this is the part that really brings me here Um uh see we are like in a very very weird space right now with humanity Very exciting Okay And if we truly have to be successful all the AI builders and creators here okay some of the things that I got inspired from league one you can be embedded Okay And I'm headed towards why is this really needed um number one we need like a very strong leadership as he tells we need iron in us Okay very difficult to get but something that we have to number two is we have to economically align it Okay Have the hard work in a very deep tech way Not just shallow uh charg rappers Okay Uh the deeper we go the more rewards we get and make the mission bigger than the money Okay So this part is I spend a lot of time on to obviously the greatest entrepreneurs have lived for a mission way beyond like Elon wants to go to Mars right and uh you always saw Lee Kuanu he always had this that he wants to make Singapore the best metropolis even before it was right Um how does this come you know spending a lot of time onto this I found that it comes from a sense of ownership Okay The way he owned Singapore the way he cared about Singaporeans was way different than how many of us are building our products or caring about the developers or the enterprises that will use them Okay Um there is also more into so fundamentally if you go to some numbers ballpark figures he took it you know from 0 to 2 trillion in 50 years But if you go further if you take the whole of humanity you know in spite of that energy you the the number is 0 to 100 trillion in 500 years Okay the things are starting to feel way overwhelming at the level of an individual right but this is this is still job not done I mean I come from physics and this is all known now Um we are right there like we are really it's unimaginable to uh properly build a civilization that can go beyond earth Yes Elon talks about mass and maybe we go to moon again Um but the the size the time involved okay the money involved is just way huge Okay None of us will be here by the time we become that future of humanity that is going to that the solution all of you are going to create it Part of what I realized was we need to build a future where the ownership is decentralized If this ownership can bring that attitude of mission is greater than the money and that creates a powerful effect creates a country like Singapore Okay that is how do we bring that decentralized ownership Okay How does it go beyond an individual you know whatever CEO Elon doing or Zuckerberg doing or Trump doing or whatever it is it goes beyond from that to a country level and how does it also go beyond countries Okay Um one solution towards that is with the blockchain Okay Fundamentally in GPUet and in any blockchain the backend system is shared Okay Whatever at the end of the day you do your job Okay Okay I see I give you salary or okay okay you did that job I give you you don't do I I I block you off or I sanction your money or I stop your business In a blockchain it's all shared Okay So the ownership of the action is on the uh distributed ledger That's fundamentally it and the money okay which is the economically aligned part that is also shared towards this in us So we have a token uh you know dollar GPU but we have not kept any team tokens for us Okay this marks a very very big difference in the same way uh even bitcoin did not have any team tokens or nowadays you'll see a lot of 99% projects you know there's like uh foundation tokens marketing tokens advisory tokens this that many ways to kind of not do great things okay so that is one powerful way where we want to contribute u Q to hit the video Um there's way more into GPU net [Music] [Music] [Music] Yes So we have our blockchain which is our layer 1 Then we have the compute which sits on top and then we have the applications uh which are called subnets And how we have designed is is that if all of us whatever we are creating could be AI for healthcare AI for fintech AI for governments or it could be AI for the moon uh the real economy to come on the moon is you can create it as as an application there You can use this underlying compute network Okay You can also be a contributor If you are a big data center you can contribute the compute as well Okay And then these joint network of people uh become this owners of the economy of the platform of the tokens and of the action This thing is proven to a high extent where projects like Ethereum and Solana have done really good in terms of network effects Um my only uh goal for all of us would be to every day uh we have 100 things in our life to do but every day spare out some time into figuring out a solution as to how can we all be one or how can we all be economically aligned towards one direction Okay And this is like the most powerful thing that can make us achieve our company goals whatever users or revenue we want to target valuation or success And this is also the future of humanity",
