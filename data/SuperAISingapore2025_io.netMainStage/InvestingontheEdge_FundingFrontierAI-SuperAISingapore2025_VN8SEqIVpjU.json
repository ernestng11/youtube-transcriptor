    "aggregated_text": "on stage with me we have the powerhouse VCs talking about funding Frontier AI so before we jump into questions I'd like for each of you to just give a quick intro on yourself your background and your fund starting with you Andy great good afternoon everyone my name is Andy Tang um um with Draper Associates and I joined the firm in 2007 um and you probably have either heard of or worked with my partner Tim Draper so we have been investing together last uh 20 years uh and I'm a generalist and we're early stage venture fund seed to growth uh and happy to be here hi I'm Kylie 500 global uh we built our firm based on this idea that like the largest outcomes in the world have the majority of their revenues outside of the US but also including the US so whether it's going up from like 10 billion 50 100 all the way up you see this percentage go up so to build a platform that can invest in companies and take them all around the world what does that look like and how can we build that across decades so today we managed about two bill over $2 billion we've invested in 3,000 companies in 80 countries we got a network of partners and hopefully we can like build up to that dream um yeah that's me um very glad to be here uh always a pleasure um thank you for having us i'm H Mahapatra from Lightseed lightseed is a global venture capital firm based in Silicon Valley parts of Europe India Singapore and China he managed about $30 billion of capital globally and uh you know very very active uh investors in uh AI globally we've made investments in practically every single foundation model company out there um we are uh building a we are investing in a lot of application and solution companies uh globally and uh very active uh you know in in sovereign AI which is one of the topics we'll talk about today across all regions companies like Mistral uh in uh France Sarbam in India and uh uh and tropic in the US awesome so as we think about Frontier AI I think it's important to set the stage with how you all define what Frontier AI is given that every day we're seeing a new AI company pop up so how are you guys identifying which companies are truly cutting edge versus what are smoking mirrors we can start with you Andy uh sure so um so I kind of think about this idea of frontier AI uh as um it's kind of the level impact right when I think about there's the regular AI and there's the frontier AI and the way I think about it is um this is really potentially the fourth industrial revolution right so if you think about the first three in case you don't know you do uh electricity um actually before that steam engine steam engine electricity and electronics so think about how each one of those things change the way um we live how humanity evolve and then that level impact and that's how we kind of think about what we think about the frontier AI um and I'll kind of give a very short example of how I think about what's interesting um with AI these days answers are really easy to come by right easy to find but good questions are hard to find right so if you think about this um really interesting AI model this idea of the ability to have um sort of problem solving uh multimodal reasoning um planning execution um if you put all that together I think that makes it a really interesting um frontier AI um and I'll do a small plug for the three of us since we're in the venture capital business right so you have some good ideas and I'll just say um you know you probably wonder why the heck does this guy bring up a baseball i was afraid i've never been on a panel with somebody with a weapon before this is like I was I was like shivering behind this could be a weapon this is really a sporting equipment right so if you have interesting ideas come give us your best pitch haman with you know live speed and then Alex with 500 startup um global and Andy with um Draper Funds you know we'll hit it out of the park and then I don't think any one of us are aiming for just regular Unicorn or you know a home run or even decacorn we're thinking grand slams right grand slams yes grand slams and hectoorns hundred billion dollars in market cap right so with that love it how how's that you know we need to fill these seats if you're if there are people outside they should be coming in where else are you going to find a panel with a baseball bat and a baseball right only here andy actually flew 16 hours from San Francisco with this i couldn't let you in you know what I mean i didn't like frisk any of security breach and I'm not taking that home with me in San Francisco so one of you is going to get the baseball and the baseball bat and he's he's going to sign it yeah all right Kaylee on next to you um well Hamman's going to go first i'm kidding uh okay here here's how I break it down right what's frontier versus normal AI i think right now uh when we experience AI today it feels like a very smart human kind of like a superhuman but what would a god do what what is human mode AI versus god mode AI gods can be described as omni knowowing omni potent can know everything and do everything and in that case like what's the difference between human mode AI currently we are prompting AIs to do stuff but when AI prompts us or maybe we are actually moving and acting in ways where we're not even prompted at all but we're actually guided by this God and is this God going to be a benevolent God a wrathful God and is there a God that we can have a real true connection with that is in service to all humanity i think taking some of this spiritual lens helps me kind of like differentiate the AI we use today and the AI that is being developed right now that feels dangerous to a lot of people alex are you sure that's not just your wife omni knowing i don't know man um look I mean I I I agree with I think what has been said let me let me put a different perspective on this um look I think the world and the way we see it we see kind of pretty much whatever is happening around the world in AI and it's it's actually one of the most interesting times at least in my venture career um every 30 40 maybe 50 years the world goes through what I call an innovation super cycle uh what is a super cycle a super cycle starts when you know 30 40 years of research that has literally gone to the ground in some cases like in the case of oil and steam it unlocks a new resource that you can then scientifically discover extract and then commercialize and when you are able to scientifically discover extract and commercialize in a repeatable way that resource over time becomes ubiquitous cheap and available to everybody and if it is a programmable resource like steam is programmable uh oil is programmable uh CPUs are programmable GPUs are programmable AI token is programmable when these resources are programmable then you can unlock a new industry in its entirety so what happened 100 years ago before oil became commercially and readily available 30 40 50 years of research had gone into figuring out where the hell to dig so that oil comes out from the ground and one the US figured it out they ended up occupying every country that had potential for oil because they knew that if I go to this region or that region and I dig I will get oil and and that super cycle that took 50 60 70 80 years to run its course meant that if you are in the beginning of the super cycle the frontier of the super cycle is the extractive part of the industry the companies that extract oil and make it available for others to do something with are at the frontier as the cycle matures those who are extracting are no longer the frontier anymore they become commoditized the value moves upstream it's about what you do with the oil the car companies acrew value the airplane companies acrew value petroleum product companies acrew value if you invested in a uh Exxon stock in 1990s you would have basically come about at the same price 20 30 years later the right place to put your money was a different frontier called internet so the same thing happened with CPUs and the CPU cycle became commoditized the value moved from putting money into an AMD or Intel to putting money into a Google or a Microsoft today what's happening is we are going through we have gone through 30 40 years of ex of research and development and now we have extracted this new godlike resource that you talked about which is an AI token which is programmable and readily available and getting cheaper by the minute and the first few years of an extractive cycle you should put money the frontier is the extractive businesses who extracts the GPU cycles the GPU companies the uh the companies that are building the uh the the fabs Right tsmc's above that are foundation model companies above that are data companies above that are application companies so we have very quickly moved from the frontier being AS6 and GPUs to maybe foundation model companies that will get commoditized over time to then it's the middleware companies which was the hottest sector last year to now what we are coming to is the application layer companies and a genetic infra company which is where the frontier is and tomorrow the frontier might be doing science with AI doing research and development with AI so that's how the frontier moves and if you are missing the boat and you put money into a the previous cycle of what Frontier used to be you will lose money so you got to be as investors we got to be very cutting edge all the time but that's what we think about when we think about Frontier as what is currently h has the most alpha and where are in the cycle we are because the cycles also compress very quickly what took 80 years for oil would not take more than 80 years for AI uh can I riff on what he just shared i think that's actually a very refreshing and insightful way to kind of parse where the idea of frontier actually shifts right as things get commoditized i think on a quantitative basis uh you mentioned we're in a cycle of um maybe towards applications would that be right to say yeah I think we are moving because the initial cycle was more about and you know the frontier if you're towards like right now in AI the only two places that are easy to invest for us one is the absolute left which is the data centers the energy companies the AS6 and all because it's clearly value is acrewing there and on the other side are basically uh consulting companies Because Price Waterhouse Coopers makes a billion dollars in revenue in purely in AI and I'm sure other companies do that everybody in the middle is kind of figuring it out and the more in the middle you are the less clear it is middleware companies are the hardest to invest in but value excitement and developer interest moves from the bottom to the top as the bottom gets more figured out and now that's what's happening the foundation model companies have basically they're not competing on performance as much they are competing on price because that's how the bottom layer works it works on commoditization of the bottom layer which is why the most investable companies the bottom layer are the ones that already have a lot of money not the new ones but already are capital intensive because they can price war you out of the bottom layer and once you are winning the bottom layer you have planted your flag and then every apartment that is built on your land is going to pay you rent for the next 50 years and that's who are the apartments the apartments are agentic infrastru I I think that on the platform layer and the compute the core comput LLMs then on top let's say on the other end you've got applications then you got the middleware companies in between I'm like noticing like this is instead of a three layer sandwich I'm having like this like triple big Mac or something there's like so many layers right there's rappers on rappers like we were talking about superbase earlier in the back you know it's infra but it's also services on infra for example so there is like um value capture at different parts of that but the second thing that really kind of itch to scratch is that when I ask chat GBT how many users you have like every other month it says that 500 million now 600 million for example but I also know that there are 5.5 billion internet users maybe a billion of them use copilot maybe a billion of them use Gemini and whatnot right but how about the rest of the 4 billion people like are they using derivative applications from LLMs or maybe they have even tried they haven't had their first LLM experience then I think about all the unicorns that exist today the 1300 unicorns that exist in Crunchb right now and how many of them are ready to be disrupted on the consumer application layer because of AI so I actually do believe that there is a massive land grab opportunity we just have to ship really quickly and iterate really fast like get customers use the customer trust and relationship and workflow and UX as the moat and then start growing and building from there it's messy but once you got a wedge into the messiness and you got first 100 million customers to 10 million customers build super fast right and then hopefully that you build your bridge to something that's really fantastic but I don't know I get I get a lot of flack for that that idea so I don't know like what my fellow investors here think i mean I I I I definitely think um that the we kind of live in the bubble right we all use you know chat GPT perlexity or whatever um but the rest of the world I think the adoption has been very slow right so I think we got to do something to figure out how to to be a adoption um but I think in terms of thinking about we're always thinking well so I think Haman said very well there's the application side as a frontier now because I think the LLM battle is done we're thinking how could you combine certain vertical applications to create the next frontier right so the wave on top of the wave yeah so there's really two things going on there is the adoption for the rest of the world i think you what did you mention is that five billion five and a half billion internet users around the world yeah yeah right so there there's a lot of people who are not using it right there's that and then there's the people who are using it what can we um other applications can we combine like physical you know AI that kind of thing implementation creating more interesting front the next frontier yeah I think the biggest barrier to adoption is technologies ourselves because if we're like so deep into the tech there's a lot of UX things which are completely missing so I'll give you an example right people like oh we can use AI to automate anything all right Zapier's like taking a lot of this this stuff right I had with one of my AI founders I say hey have you automated anything he's got like a proper AI company right like doing this and I say have you use Zabier to automate anything okay let's just automate something right now so we spent like 15 minutes in front of Xavier okay and and Zaber even launched like a Vibe automation thing he got lost he gave up right and I helped him out with a few things because the schematics are so-called no code low code is this graph and you're drawing arrows in this bubbles it's as good as code guys come on right it's not there yet on the UX we don't have like the Canva of automation just yet you're still at like the Photoshop of automation do you know what I mean so I just think that the UX guys UX we need more designers building AI we need more product developers i think you need an AI to help AI adoption then it would just solve its own problem and it'll be done with oh I'm working on that believe me i love how this question has spurred a ton of different discussions um so I guess moving on we are in a moment where AI is radically on sorry where AI is radically lowering the barrier to entry in terms of building startups and there are companies launching with much leaner teams nowadays um how is this changing how you evaluate early stage companies and is having um a leaner team a um sign of leverage or is that going to raise questions about defensibility and execution you can take it i'm I'm I'm very happy to go look I think this is this is not unexpected right um if you were to build a billion dollar revenue company aundred years ago you probably need I don't know million people to do it it's not it wasn't easy just to start i mean I remember as a colleague of mine way back when when he started a company in 1998 uh this is much before my time i was still in school back then but you know you told the story that the job to start a company you had to go find some place to rent and get servers and desktops and setup and power cables and then you didn't have cloud so you had to go get hardware to store stuff and get licenses and they would come on CDs to your offices and you install them and it will take months to do it right and it will require a lot of people to do it today people pay you money to start a company you go to Amazon and they will give you half a million dollars to start something and we have seen companies that have you know 100 500,000 people that are a you know 100 million $200 million revenue businesses it is much easier to start and it is much easier to scale now the good thing about that is anybody and everybody not anybody literally but you know many more people can be entrepreneurs the bad thing about that is the revenue pool gets fragmented quite quickly so what we see happening is it is much easier now than it ever was to build a million dollar $5 million revenue business it is much harder now to build a billion dollar revenue business why because the there are ton and ton of these $1 million businesses that eat your revenue away right they will say okay well you don't get white glove service i have a person who will just do it for you and their margin is 85% i will take 75% and I'll give you customer service but I don't really care about building a $5 million business i'm happy with 2 million 30% you know IIDA and 5% free cash flow it's good for me so the world does not expand infinitely so the but the bar to build small companies has come dramatically down the bar to build big companies has gone dramatically up so we still care about pretty much the same thing ambition clarity of thinking aggression uh and you know the ability to really attract talent and capital towards you is as important as ever was in the days of Rockefeller you go first i was going to say um so this is really interesting you you brought up this idea of it's so much easier to start business and I'd love to hear Alex's view because 500 has been known to My name is Kylie by the way just Right um to uh to to to to help people start business right so I remember when I first started we when we invest in companies it's like $5 million to start a software company because you have to buy servers right um but obviously with Amazon web servers you don't need to do that anymore um and I think you we have already been on a um a trend of capital efficiency and talent efficiency and I think AI is the piece that's really bringing that talent efficiency to the extreme uh sadly we're seeing all the layoffs to the big companies but I think that that's the beginning of people doing more with less y and we're going to see that we have seen that in startups um to the extreme and we have always believe been believers of lean teams right people fewer number of people and I think you're going to see that in multiples of you know sort of multiples of act magnitude right because of the things um these new engineers could do with AI um that they weren't able to do before um and I and I think I'll go back to what Steve Jobs used to say is the A players hire A players right so we're looking for those A players who will hire very few A players and get a lot of done with very few people now you got a players creating a a agents a agents will create a players again yeah there you go there you go that's god mode right there finding a venture capitalist yes like us yeah hopefully or just like tapping a capital but coming to your question um I I I'll share with you like a quick story to encapsulate like how I feel about this and I'll tell you my biggest concern now the Dualingo of course teaching English is like I said teaching languages learning languages big company we didn't back we didn't get a chance to back into Dualingo at all um he's I mean the founder has gotten some flak for what he's mentioned about AI and implementation of AI publicly whatever we backed a company from a little known uh edge of Eastern Europe um called Practica.ai joined one of our little accelerator programs we were doing for the government of Georgia at the time as part of our venture development work there two months they built a product to learn English by talking to a video avatar you have free free talk you just like talk about whatever you want to talk about and it corrects your English and and and that right 12 months after they shipped that product they collected $20 million US of revenue in the 12 months after they shipped the product and then because they was profitable they moved to Dubai for tax optimization but it was easy for them to move because they only had two staff so it was so so two two founders and two staff and $20 million collected revenue what are you going to do right you're going to build a company like you want to hire 100 people like what what are you going to do next So they wanted to go for another language it's not English right but they have to really rebuild from scratch right so I think it's interesting for us because it's like I would love to have more ownership in that company but at what price and can I really do they really need more money if they've collected 20 bucks of revenue so I I'm a little concerned of two things number one is that we've graduated at 500 from seed investing all the way to like cutting to $10 million checks we have a facility for some types of companies that we can do 20 to $30 million but it's like what if that's not needed for the most successful companies how do I actually get the most ownership up front if I'm being really greedy but I've got another concern for myself out of the the many um unicorn companies I have in our portfolio which of them are the dual lingos that will be disrupted by a lean AI startup that's going to come up and start giving them some serious challenge right like we got some companies in the call center software space for example and I'm like okay and they are saying they're an AI company but somebody else has no baggage and they are completely super native in AI and they're taking customers like crazy so I am afraid I've got NAV risk you know like do I just mark them down because they're not AI enough so you know I need to return money to my investors so I need to make sure my existing champions in my portfolio are well decked against the AI onslaught of some of the lean AI builders as well right so yeah opportunity and also a risk yeah it's definitely a much more competitive space on top of an already competitive space and I know you mentioned some traits of what makes the company successful um which type of founders do you think are best positioned to uh really succeed in this next wave of AI you call what i I've mic hogged enough i'm going to step out you guys Okay maybe I'll say something to to get started um I think um I think Hammon actually mentioned this a little bit of the the stage in which the industry is at right you you started the foundation model right and then we're moving to applications um I think AI is still fairly technical at this point fairly technical right at some point I think it should become less technical and more human you know to for adoption so I think at this moment I'm still I still have a bias i've always had a bias towards technical founders but I think um we have gone from super technical to now technical right um because it's still a very high technical problem barrier to entry to solve but at some point I think we probably need to be shifting more towards um two two things one is um which I talked about earlier integration with other technology other verticals so those are less technical but more about you know multiddiscipline and then um adoption which is more about just appealing to human users to use this new technology okay so super interesting that's still technical depth that's Yeah but becoming less so on a daily basis i'm I'm hoping yeah yeah and so now that we kind of cover like you know what companies get funded um we have a good representation from around the world so we have Andy from the US Kylie from Southeast Asia and Hamont from India i'd love to know from like those different regions like what do you think the advantages are and the challenges are to building in each of those respective regions i mean look from India there is at this specific to AI but maybe broadly applies broadly as well india is actually a really really large pool of talent and we are at the end of the day in the talent business in fact what we see in the US about 40 to 50% of the deals we do especially in enterprise and AI are Indian founders that were born brought up in India and then moved to the US and studied there and you know uh worked there and then ended up starting a company so from a pure intellect hustle hunger ambition you know the core intrinsics of what makes a great entrepreneur we we see a lot of that in India and in Indians that are not in India and that doesn't change um second now this goes back to whether we are in the extractive part of the cycle or we are in the late part of the cycle which is more distributive where building net new frontier stuff is less important your Dropbox is no different from my Google drive is no different from your office 365 is no different from whatever distribution matters more your brand matters more your sales and marketing hustle matters more your partnerships matter more um so depending on where we are in the cycle the answers will change but today we are still in more of an extractive part of the cycle an extractive part of the cycle for AI requires three things it requires algorithmic superiority so you can just get to climb the hill faster to the answers you require data superiority and you require talent superiority now sorry not talent talent is the same as algorithms because talent is the one that's going to build algorithms is more compute so algorithms data and compute i think India does not have enough talents today sitting in India that can do foundation level work we have some pockets and their pockets are expanding very quickly and there's a ton of people moving back from other parts of the world to India to build companies in India and we backed a bunch of those uh but it is not at the same level as China and the US so we have to be very selective in that part of the stack on compute i think if there's enough talent compute and dollars will come we've invested 40 $45 million into serum uh and they're raising a lot more so dollars will come the data is where I think India has a massive advantage who do you think has the largest corpus of human level data for medical research that's Indians it is an open market it is the largest corpus and an open corpus who do you think has the largest corpus of video data that's Bollywood who do you think has the largest corpus of audio data let's say second most followed channel on YouTube called TCDs it's an audio company in India it's second after only uh Mr beast and so on and so forth who do you think has the largest corpus of call center data across text uh and and phone calls it's India and so on and so forth so if you are to use the data as your advantage assuming the playing field is equal on compute and on algorithms/talent India has a massive advantage we just have to go find a way to deploy it but that's the advantage that India has i I've I've been reflecting on this a little bit more because um I think geography can be used as leverage like and and there great examples especially India like if you have a much smaller country with no talent or whatever like this there's maybe you have to leverage it in a different way but I also have started to see a lot of geography as a prison you know some companies they spend like 6 7 8 9 10 years serving say just Southeast Asia but if their niche is a certain niche there's only so many people who can pay for that type of business in Southeast Asia so they they hardly can get to $100 million US revenue business as a result so but there are a lot of underserved markets around the world if they translate their offering the B2B SAS into Danish and just launch in Denmark you know and you know treat their global expansion as a story of cities that they can kind of cater as opposed to so they don't have to like oh I'm a Southeast Asian company so I need to build for Southeast Asia for example right like don't use it as don't let it be like a prison for you use it as leverage where these different geographies have advantages for so I think the best examples and the biggest outcomes that we've seen from backing like companies like Canva or talk desk is that they they like say Canva starting in Australia use that I mean you work with what you got right if you're in Australia okay you take it you got talent over there but as they serve the revenue and get revenue from around the world they continue to leverage Australia in different way and the talent pools over there but they've also built offices and hire people all around the world as well so I think if you stay revenue religious and a bit like geographically agnostic I think you have like a better chance of designing a company that is truly globally significant definitely all right so we are running close to time with less than two or less than three minutes um I wanted to know if you guys had to write a $10 million check tomorrow into any Frontier AI space where would it go uh I I've been very vocal on my LinkedIn um I like um I'm an engineer by training which means I prefer not to take science science risks or you know highly you know difficult technical risks so I like to take different silos of um sectors that already been proven AI autonomous driving um microp payments on crypto uh you know crisper healthcare technology and kind of put them together kind of integration play so I I would like to back um technologies by combining two sectors reduce the technical risk but I'll take the commercialization and adoption risk oh we'll leave the best the the ones with the biggest check writing for last i'll go next you read the check to us yeah exactly right so we got some companies to you Herman you know what I mean but but I'm definitely I'm definitely following adoption curves and valuation curves right cuz sometimes like uh VCs you back ahead of adoption because you believe the adoption is going to go up and then you pay for it right and some companies get overvalued because they pay too much and then the adoption actually tails off but I feel like there's a lot of companies that are built by builders in a lot of these meetups and I go to these grassroot meetups because I like hanging out with builders at these meetups and I meet like I this is a really good friend of mine now he's 27 years old like he doesn't like he's kind of stealthy but his company solo builder like 14 months in is doing 60,000 MR it's just him and himself there's an Indonesian company out of Bandong we really wanted to back this dude he hasn't even graduated yet his his that one I can out his company is called Photosolve.ai AI was doing like 50k MR and he hasn't graduated yet has all his customers from the US all his customer acquisitions off Tik Tok you know but eventually he got an acquisition offer so he's not taking VC money anymore right so it's kind of like I I feel like the if these are folks which are gems for me like the practica.ai AI kind of examples because they're getting massive adoption but they've not been recognized or seized yet or or or been given the chance to get two three 5 million US dollars for funding or 10 million US for funding to build something truly huge the risk I'm taking there is a different type of execution risk because it's it's one thing to be an AI builder it's another to be a company builder and that's where like like us at 500 we hope to support them with a community and some services to really help them build the companies out of their AI dreams no look I I think building a company is in no way needs to be performative so best entrepreneurs don't really care what VCs are looking for yep so keeping that aside cuz I do really believe that the best entrepreneurs don't need to worry about what we care about they just need to build to their customers needs and people will come running to pay you um what what I do think is now possible for the very first time in my venture career is to build something that the world has never seen and what we tend to see a lot of I think globally is you know we've got we've got the we've got we've got oil and we've got horses and we see many entrepreneurs trying to feed the oil to the horse expecting it to run faster what they should be thinking about is where do I put this oil so we don't need the horse anymore what took 10 days 10 months should take 10 seconds okay so what I'm looking for is to be surprised uh in a way that I jump out of my seat and say \"Oh my god I did not think this thing was actually possible.\" because their technology is almost there where you can build stuff that will surprise and wow and and really make you think very differently both in core science where there is science risk and I agree and pure engineering risk so what am I looking for to put 10 15 20 is an element of surprise without it having to be performative in its nature an element of surprise where I feel like this stuff looks like a car and I don't know what a car looks like because nobody has shown a car to me but this thing runs faster than a horse ever will and will run longer than a horse ever will with no maintenance what does that look like i don't know but a great entrepreneur will have this taste for it and they will show it to us and then that's where my money goes yep thank you so if you guys are building something with a wow factor you know where you're getting $10 million tomorrow all right well thank you so much for the insightful panel",
