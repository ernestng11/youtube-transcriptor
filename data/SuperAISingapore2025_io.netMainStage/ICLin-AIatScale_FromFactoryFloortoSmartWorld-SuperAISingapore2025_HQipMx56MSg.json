factories yes but also we are the AI factories we build lots of the hardware and we build you know something most important intelligent at scale not just for ourself but also for our industry and partners we serve today I love to show you what this means and more important might be matter to you now allow me to just a moment give me a little bit commercial fast is not just manufacturing muscles our revenue revert of the small countries so our chairman asked what's next the bar is high that's how we come out a street strategy the three future industries the EV robotic and also the digital healthy powered by the three technologies the AI semiconductors and also the the you know the nextG communications because we knew we had infrastructures And now it's time to build a intelligence on top of that now allow me to you know the in two 2020s in the FastCon actually we you know to have the you know the we launched the Hongghai Research Institute not keep up with the chance but also define lamb we have the five research centers plus the one quantum lab our AI teams you know sit next to the quantum lab the computing guys and it keeps everyone humbles so we believed you know the from semiconductor through the cyber security this institute not polish power points but also shop the futures okay so at fastcon AI is not a accessory it becomes the engines from detect you know the predictions and also the energy optimizations we embed AI throughput you know our operations our factory not just execute we and test anticipate every months Our system set a little bit you know smarter and learning compounds across thousands of the workflow we manage i think you know we can all agreed AI is option is not option anymore is not R&D is return of the investment from consumer electronics to the edge devices you know we integrate the intelligent into everything and from the routers to hops and also to the cameras the business you know share of the AIdriven solution is grows fast and not because trended but also is usable you can see in our trends the business share of the AI related platform and services is growing is not a spike is the tragedies from beginning component to be the core ai reshape how we think about of the product portfolio and more importance how our customer you know think about working with us then came the gen AI suddenly everyone wants more compute more bandwidth and you know the less of the latencies not just drive the demand ai not just drive the demand but it change expectations and when expectations meet the physical world less the fastcon show up we know how we design the system we build the bors eventually we can get the 20 countries you know at once that's our value we operize AI fast here are quite wing of the AI when technology works invisible but impactables a street camera recognize unsafe motions and flag it the doorbell know whether it should notify you or not and AI system they may know your grandma hasn't opened the fridge for all days none of these require the cloud to be flooded with footage the age handle it locally security and responsibility let's bring down to the street labels from city block to the door steps intelligence is shows up when lives happens h AI helps telecom partners manage the traffic and spot risks and send real time alert right on the street at your door smart camera they can do more than a record they understand they note the difference between the pet the packaging and also the shred and only alert when it matters all the process at age faster prep private and also the secure not a cloud delayed just instant intelligent response this is the AI getting through usable in smart city imag manage the traffic and emergency in the real time in the LD care is spar unusual behavior like skip the routine and send alert when something abnormal in home security it filter noise and react only real stress all thanks to H A AI all devices process video locally and react instantly and send only what needed to be cloud is faster more private and essential for the safety our telecom partners rely on it because the response time matters age made the difference so when we talk about what's happen on the ground let's look up to the sky to the space one of the three core technology we bet on the nextG communication including the LEO lower Earth orbit satellites in late 2023 we launched our own satellites yes really two of them still running right there and they are observation they are doing the experiment why because if AI make traffic smarter the image which could be do the orbital communications here comes the you know the is very exciting things leo satellites combined with the AI they can do the spark change in forest fear and or oceans they predict the weather faster and also the more accurately the defect nature you know they can detect the nature disaster faster is that giving the satellites eyes and brand that's not just taking the pictures they are analyzing predictings and help us acting like the not too too late let me leave you one of the sort what connect a robot in a factory a hub in your home and satellite in space ai not a series but the action we are not trying to put intelligent everywhere just exactly what it need thanks for joining me and this journey see you at the age and maybe in Aubrey okay guys thank you",
