    "aggregated_text": "so uh cyber security in the age of AI is a very important topic right um you know we are no longer talking about traditional AI we're talking about AI that can create as all of us who has played with chat GPT chat GPT know and we're talking about AI that can also you know uh make decisions execute actions that can plan so we as cyber defenders uh leveraging its powerful capabilities right to further enhance our security posture whether it is to secure our network assets uh or you know financial assets right um but at the same time cyber criminals are also abusing and misusing its powerful capabilities for their malicious uh uh gains So to innovate with confidence in this age of AI we have to we have to enhance our security posture our people our policies our technology stack right Um to remain resilient and to also deliver business and security outcomes we can all rely on And at the heart of this mission is the foundational principle of trust Right So for the purpose of today's uh panel discussion for the next uh 38 minutes or so we will be uh you know structuring the discussion under three themes The first theme of opportunities how we as cyber defenders are using uh AI's uh powerful capabilities The theme of uh the second theme of risk or threats how cyber criminals and try actors are abusing AI um capabilities And the third theme of trust how we embed trust as we innovate with confidence so that we can embrace these are AI powerful capabilities So without further ado so let's kick off with the first theme right so opportunities So how are we as cyber defenders are leveraging AI's are powerful capabilities So if I may come to um Stephen first if I may Right So in your discussions with your you know clients or internal stakeholders you know what are the kind of AI innovations that you see are you know truly transforming security operations Yeah So Palta networks for those of you who don't know we are an endto-end cyber security company Don't let the name networks mislead you to think that we only do network security We are truly end to end We do network cloud endpoint security operations etc Um one of the things we've noticed over the last years and it's accelerated the types of attacks that you see now are using AI to create greater volume of attacks sophistication etc The analogy we often use is if you go to a gunfight you don't want to turn up with a knife The point being is hackers are using AI in sophisticated ways to launch attacks that are so well hidden it's very difficult to identify something that is a potential threat versus that something that could be safe So in the case of our business and what we do is our role is very clear for every company organization or government we work with we want to make sure the services that are delivered can be trusted So Singapore is a great example um for Singapore citizens or PRs or permanent residents that live here You use government services with the highest level of trust That's our mission as well Now in terms of ourselves as an organization we use AI through our entire product set So if you look at security operations just to give you some crazy statistics we as an organization get attacked We have incidents against us between 1 and a half to 2 million attacks incidents per day So it's quite mindboggling We ingest 11 pabyte of data per day Why do we ingest so much data So the whole conference is about AI The bedrock you know the foundation of AI is data We ingest so much data with the purpose to understand do we can we identify a threat before it happens Do we see an anomalous behavior Can we see a pattern that typically we would not see Now think about it 11 pabyte of data almost 2 million attacks Is it possible to throw human beings against that Absolutely not So we use artificial intelligence to correlate all that data to see a pattern which typically you would not see unless you had a lot of time The problem is the hackers are in and out now within minutes It used to be days weeks and months It's minutes now So we have to use artificial intelligence to see the pattern before it happens And we're able to do that We're able to tell our customers the people we work with governments an attack is coming And that's the position we want to be in We want to be proactive Why Because all the businesses that you run and operate you have to deliver services that can be trusted and that cannot and that will not be compromised Yeah So from predictive to proactive correct right Predictive is the past to you know we have to be proactive to know that something is coming Yes Uh Carl Yeah So as CTO I'm going to talk about the T the tech Uh there's a lot happening that's powering artificial intelligence in the solutions that you're potentially looking to deploy And I kind of want to categorize it in a number of different buckets First and foremost there's actually the infrastructure infrastructure has a really important part to play in deploying and adopting and supporting AI AI has very deterministic requirements around being supported So the infrastructure is going to be a big part of that But as far as how cyber and AI coming together some of the innovations that you're starting to see the first area I guess is what we call embedded AI And Stephen kind of alluded to this that in the solutions that you're using offtheshelf solutions you're using from your different vendors there's going to be AI running in the background is going to be performing a whole bunch of functions ideally to drive better outcomes for your cyber security posture So for example it could be baselining understanding patterns looking for anomalies It could be fasttracking and detecting events that happen outside of those baselines and then be able to perform actions on that Uh it's also about maybe optimizing looking at policy You might have a very large policy list You could be looking to use AI to conversion consolidate that to make it more effective remove duplication that kind of thing So there's that embedded AI part which is of course really really important The second part of it is around the notion of AI assistance and agentic AI And so you can almost think of this as a buddy sitting there with a sec ops person as they're doing their day-to-day job using the AI assistant to ask it questions Maybe you want to interrogate some data rather than going through a whole bunch of screens to try and find a bit of data being able to type say hey can you give me some details around this particular event Bang it comes back and gives you that access So it has access to the same amount of information that a sec ops person would have using their normal dashboards but is going to be able to deliver that information in a more timely manner to the operator hopefully making them more productive in the work that they do The agents themselves also are important because they're going to be doing the the role of the operator So David so so Steven was kind of giving an example where you could have a hacker coming in an individual person might not necessarily be able to identify that but that agentic AI can be able to identify and perform actions on behalf of the company So that's another really important part of the tech and uh the solutions that are powering cyber The third area is in the area of solutions to actually protect AI itself So AI whether it's a model whe it's an application it represents an attack surface that a thread actor can look to use to try to compromise So for example you're downloading a model from hugging face How do you know if that model has some malware embedded in that A normal antivirus is not going to help you there Other solutions will will need to be to be used to identify that Looking at other areas of misuse data poisoning exfiltration uh what we call excessive consumption There's a whole host of vulnerabilities that those AI models are going to have and you need to have systems in place to be able to protect that You also need to start thinking about the use of those models Most of the security solutions in the industry today are really good at determining who can access an application So Carl can access payroll application Carl can access this application That's what a typical security solution is going to provide you But once you give someone access to that application how do you then determine how or secure how the user uses that application There's many instances and you can read on you can do searches on Google A famous one which was about a year ago a car dealership in Northern California decided to move into the 21st century and and decided to offer a chatbot powered by a custom large language model seeing in the background to help their customers buy Chevrolet cars Now of course some smart individual decided to use and leverage a vulnerability of large language models It's called an indirect prompt injection attack and they were able to reconfigure the large language model and convince it to sell it a car that person a car for a dollar Um you don't want that to happen So that's another aspect of technology we're starting to look at to provide you with a better way in which you can secure the infrastructure the applications the models and the data that's going to power that AI that's ultimately going to improve your security posture organization All right Thanks Kyle You touched on a lot of points that we are going to cover later in the panel aantic AI uh kind of a data poisoning pro injection um but before we deep dive into some of these uh aspects I'd like to come to pro so what kind of examples have you seen you know in the area of fraud intelligence uh how AI is powering uh some of these u uh predictive to proactive threat intelligence or other um business outcomes right first of all thanks for having me it's a pleasure to be here and to give you a little bit of context Uh Fidzy uh is a company that does fraud detection and anti-money laundering and account opening uh fraud detection for large banks from large banks to small banks from payment processors and networks So we work across the globe Right now we are protecting about 1 billion consumers worldwide in about 180 countries Um overall uh our uh amount of money that we are um protecting last year got to $6 trillion We are on track to be at $8 trillion So it's a huge volume of of um transactions and payments that we are protecting worldwide We have been using AI for about 10 years now in production So all all of these transactions and payments and transfers are being already protected uh with AI uh worldwide for our clients and their and their clients Um we've seen that in the last few years with with Genai uh frosters are also using AI quite a lot Uh it is lowering the barrier of entry for frosters It's allowing more personalized attacks It's allowing a new scale of attacks Now they can automate and and and do sometimes like a thousand or 10,000 attacks with small variations to try to find which ones work better They're able to do personalized attacks that sometimes look out of science fiction For example simulating a Zoom call where everybody is fake Um so you think you're talking with your chief financial officer that is giving you some instructions to to do a transfer but in in fact that person doesn't exist It's it's a virtual person with virtual voice but it looks like your colleague Um and of course this is increasing the effectiveness of these attacks Uh the amount estimated to be lost by scams in 2024 worldwide was $1 trillion uh worldwide which it's a lot of money So on our side the good guys fighting these things we've been using uh AI a lot u in m mostly two ways one is what we call prevention so is better and better models uh so we are always evolving our AI publishing papers in the top conferences and and patents and our scientific work and even releasing stuff in open source um we are also also using Gen AI to generate synthetic data For example pretending the AI to be a rogue agent to try to bypass the model to generate data so that we can now train models with more data and better data to be more robust So that's uh one way we are also using uh large language models and large vision models to prevent scams So sometimes when you get a text u a WhatsApp or SMS message or you're on a site doing a purchase we can analyze with a screenshot that and analyze both the image and the text the price the stars and tell the person raise some alert saying oh the price is too good to be true or this vendor has no no history uh or this URL does not match the company URL So we are raising alerts for people to protect their scams So so we have this arm of using AI for good which is prevention And then we have the other arm which we call productivity So helping the analysts um do their work faster For example one thing that they need to do very often is to come up with rules quickly There's a very specific attack and they want to stop that attack and they want to write the rule for that attack And we have now uh large language models so that they can help write in plain English They write a rule and that rule gets translated into features and and and and models that are then going to boot in production more quickly Uh we also have what we call a case summary agent Going back to the point of agent AI many times when a transaction is deemed to be suspicious to be fraud it goes to a queue and analysts are looking to those transactions to the past history of the card and terminal And many times they even go online and search for that vendor or that merchant on Google or Wikipedia or Forsquare and all of those things were adding time to the analysts So now we are using agents to summarize that information so that at a glance they can have all of that information very quickly show to them Uh and by that we are able to reduce fraud and optimize their their productivity And we are also deploying uh you probably heard the MCP the model context protocol that was released uh a little while ago by entropic Uh we are also developing that at FISA So that our clients the banks and networks can bring their own agents to FISA and use them to create rules create models deploy things more quickly Right Yes So innovation is not just about adopting the latest cutting edge uh technology but it's also solving very real business challenges as you pointed out and also delivering some of these uh benefits and I think many of the benefits that you mentioned is productivity gains and also uh improved uh accuracy um in many ways um and one emerging sort of benefit that you have also uh touched on very lightly is um uh uh elevating analysts from the heavy lifting right to uh doing more of the strategic uh kind of thinking training the AI to do more um with better rules Um so Steve Steven if I may come to you how do you see the you know potential of agentic AI to further enhance the security posture Okay so this is uh the latest hot topic agentic AI Okay Um before I I'll come to that but I just want to pivot from what my learned colleagues were just touching on If you look at what's playing out in the industry be it may around payments realtime payments cyber etc The historical position has been an incident happens you create a rule These are correlation rules I mean you heard Pedro talk about creating rules How efficient is this There are so many attacks and variations you're responding to create a rule This is post the incident Is it the most effective way of dealing with a threat Probably not Okay The the purpose of artificial intelligence and and here's the other point I want to make We're at a conference You hear the terms large language models machine learning deep learning generative AI It's really important we as students understand these are all slightly different Okay these terms are used so different I mean in interchangeable but in fact they're slightly different I mean the purpose of machine learning ultimately is to create automation to take away the workload The benefit since you're talking about agenic AI where can we take the workload of repetitive tasks The problem with agenic agenic AI is it is starting to make decisions that we may not be able to predict You know when you have a device it's very black you know ABC outcomes You can create policies and rules a genic AI The the danger we have here is you have the possibility of whatever you want to call it a being or whatever to make decisions that may be unpredictable but but coming back to my point around deep learning machine learning generative AI all of these have different roles and functions ultimately you want to where there's repetitive task to allow the artificial intelligence to automate that and propose proactively this is the rule Think about it Do you want your staff to be constantly creating correlation rules to respond to an incident Now the line of business that Pedro is dealing with banks and payment processes the line that my friend over here from Cisco and what we're in is we're trying to help organizations deliver a customer experience I I'm pretty sure most of you when you're traveling the worst thing to get is a phone call when your wife is in a shop in Italy buying expensive Italian shoes and the bank is saying \"Is it true that you're buying some shoes Should we process the credit card?\" I've had that call Okay It's irritating It's the most annoying thing So the point being is there's pressure from customers to deliver an immediate experience That's the world we live in artificial intelligence and so forth allows that decision-m to be made Now Pedro talked about you know zoom calls that are using deep fake etc What's very very interesting on top of what I talked about machine learning deep learning generative AI there's also behavioral analytics Okay there are real incidents at the moment whereby someone can sample maybe my voice perhaps not the best accent to sample Um he's he has a nicer accent Um sample that accent take the image and you get a phone call with an image and it's so lifelike you will believe it And there are many cases now where people get phone calls from the CFO we have an urgent deal going down Please transfer the money because we'll lose the opportunity If you layer on that behavioral analytics is that the typical behavior of the CFO or CEO Would he ever call you up to transfer money immediately Probably not So you see how all these different elements of AI etc can when combined you can start applying some very rational thought process And this is the point here All these different pieces together give us the opportunity to automate and make better decisions with the outcome repetitive processes AI will take over Honestly do you want your children to go and work in a call center Is that a highquality job That's where AI will help We shouldn't be fearful of that We want our friends our children etc to do highquality jobs What are those highquality jobs those high-quality jobs I I think Pedro alluded to it For ourselves our analysts now rarely deal with incidents 90 plus% of our incidents are fully automated in our company Our analysts now they spend most of their time creating black swan events We launch attacks on ourselves that we would never ever consider You know how is that possible They're paid to launch attacks on ourselves And that's the highquality work we need to be doing not firefighting Most of us at the moment are firefighting And and there's an unfortunate outcome of that situation The fatigue in the industry be it may around payment processing on credit cards be it may being an analyst in a sock be it may writing code to launch a new application is not high quality work There is churn And the problem all of us have in the industry at the moment is finding talent So that's the role of AI So I I don't want to get bogged down at agenic AI It's another hot topic Yeah Okay Maybe But we have to be weary of it because it can make decisions that are irrational How do we create policy around that Exactly Yeah Creating the policies and the governance framework accountability Right So that's one topic that we'll deep dive into under theme number three Um there's 16 minutes left and we still got to talk a little bit about five more questions Okay Right Um I know that um yes So let's move on to the second theme which is about risk and threats which you guys touch on very quickly as well Um you know data poisoning social engineering right Deep fakes and all that What is one um that you are particularly concerned about Um so we have a threat intelligence uh group within Cisco who spend kind of 247 looking at emerging threats that are coming across the landscape Um if you look at the top threats that are coming in or at least over the last 6 to9 months um one of those is fishing Uh so fishing as you probably appreciate is where you get that email you get that text you get that message trying to trick you into handing over your credentials Identity theft um is one of the biggest challenges that we face in the cyber industry and across most most companies Uh it's one of those aspects if you think about from a cyber professional standpoint defense is very difficult attack is very easy Why bang down the door knock down the door when you can just get the keys and walk in and access whatever you want And that's the whole notion behind fishing Um so there are solutions that are in place today The industry's kind of come up again using AI Um I'll give you a kind of a a quick example of how this might play So let's show say I come into the office Monday to Friday I get in the office about 7:30 in the morning open up my MacBook I connect to a particular network maybe a specific Wi-Fi network I'm accessing specific applications So the AI will build a profile a baseline around okay Carl uses a MacBook He's in this location using this network accessing these applications And now all of a sudden I inadvertently click on that um letter from Nigeria says hey I've won a million dollars And I inadvertently uh hand over my credentials Now someone elsewhere in the world has got Carl's username and password and proceeds to log in to the network to try to access to compromise some data Now the situation there is this person's logging in from a very different place that I'm normally logging in Maybe they're using a Windows laptop Maybe they're logging in at a time of day that is not normally the time of day that I normally log in They're accessing applications I don't normally access That's an anomalous event This is where an Agentic AI system can identify that and shut that down straight away Now Stephen kind of talked about early on the fact that you have hundreds thousands tens of thousands millions of incidents on a daily basis How can a mere mortal human manage that They can't So the use of those agentic AI systems in that particular case fishing is a great way to shut that threat down And it's not just fishing There's a whole host there you know social uh engineering deep fakes all of that We have solutions the industry is coming up with solutions to address those issues But the fishing one is probably the one that is of most concerning to me because it impacts my direct family Um and for that reason I'm very keen to work on solutions that can address that All right Okay Carl Uh thank you for that Um yes You have any more to add Yeah ju just to add to the fishing I couldn't agree more Um Singapore has one of the highest rates of fishing in the world It's quite astounding for a country only 5 a half million people it ranks I think top five it's one of the highest and and the point here I think is you can have the best solution you can have zero trust mentality uh systems etc there is still an element of the human factor there's an I mean one thing that has not changed is the importance of training and the mindset um unfortunately I mean why Singapore has such a high prevalence you have to understand it's an aging population Uh people like my parents come from an era where you trust people You know your neighbor You share food across the fence You chat chitchat about you know be it may cricket the football what etc You trust everyone We now live in a world unfortunately we always have to have an element of doubt Now it's a completely different mindset you have to train this mindset to have zero trust and that's not an easy thing because you you're dealing with human behavior and if you're dealing with the elderly they come from a generation where you do trust people so this is part of the problem coupled by the fact in Singapore when you have a viral WhatsApp that goes around there's a sale on Pedro Chinese New Year why don't you click on the link sailor watched road come on so this is part of the problem so that generates this behavioral aspect as well so this is very very hard But zero trust is something and a mindset we all have to be thinking about Unfortunately this is the world we live in The best example of zero trust is here when you leave Singapore You imagine you go and check in you you validate your credentials you get your boarding pass you go to the first barrier there's a police officer that checks your boarding pass you go to the iris scan that's the third check you get to the gate you get checked again And maybe the stewardess may also check where you're sitting five times your your identity gets checked That's a great example of zero trust and that's the mentality unfortunately we need to have That's the world we live in now Unfortunately right you talk about zero trust and of course uh the next theme that we're going to discuss is about embedding trust right into our security posture But uh before we go into that just very quickly um 10 minutes left uh Petro anything you want to add to fishing or any other sort of uh cyber threat landscape So maybe I can start by recommending Steven if he has many calls from the bank complaining about credit card movements Ask your bank to move to Fidai I don't own a bank but I can introduce you Um so we we've uh seen that we have been embedding AI and trust in AI for a long time Uh actually we just released a couple months ago uh what we call trust score and trust signals So it's new types of models that are ready from day zero Uh so you can just go to a a client a new client brand new client sometimes even a new product or a new region and our models because they have seen enough uh information enough transactions in enough types of attacks they are ready from the beginning For example during COVID to be honest I was a little bit afraid that our models were going to degrade because COVID was a time of uh unforeseen change right The models were not trained for that kind of behavior The the stuff that we were doing was very different People were not commuting They were not traveling so much They were buying stuff from home they were having grants to to support themselves in many geographies So I was to be honest afraid that our models were going to behave poorly but actually they they behaved greatly Uh so uh I was very of course happy and relieved with that and and looking back uh what really helped us out was that we were be able to collect all of these uh risk signals sometimes from the devices uh of people because we are uh also have a piece besides account opening and transaction fraud and and anti-money learning we also have what we call um uh device trust So we are checking uh the GPS of the device uh the phone or or or tablet Of course everything is anonymized We we we don't need to know the identity of the person but we are able to track if this is normal for this person for this time of day for this device if this is the same device that orders the payments or not as before And for example during COVID times the models actually caught even more fraud than before because there were also more more attacks So we've been embedding this zero day trust models um uh for a while now and we also developed related with your question the trust framework We released it in April The trust framework is a framework that serves as a road map and and guidance for teams that are developing uh models And it has five pillars that they compose the the trust So um transparent uh robust unbiased secure and tested And we have a number of guidelines and questions for developers uh of AI systems And by the way we call them AI systems not AI models or machine learning models because normally the system is more complex than a model It is the model plus rules plus lists plus a user interface plus the users plus explanation So the entire thing that makes decisions is the AI system So we developed this trust framework It's out there if you just Google uh feeds trust framework you'll see our page um with a with a PDF describing the framework and some questions to to guide people and to provide a score so that they can self assess and see okay we are doing well for example in transparency but not so much in the unbiased right yeah pillar so and then it gives uh directions and help we also have open-source software to help teams fulfill all of the trust pillar criteria Excellent You answer some of the questions that I was going to ask you under theme three which is about embedding trust Uh so now we are in theme tree Um if I may come to you Carl So one uh important uh pillar if I may Uh under embedding trust is about resilience and resilience of course is a big topic in cyber security You know a lot of discussions around that right Um so for our audience uh in the in in two minutes for audience to take away uh what do you want them to think about when you know they are integrating AI systems into their existing infrastructure or you know building one inhouse Sure So AI systems that you're looking to implement is another IT asset that you have to think about how you secure Um interestingly AI is a little bit different from a traditional application Traditional application you'll have a screen with a set of fixed inputs some code behind you have a very bounded structure around what inputs and what you can ask the application and then you're going to have a set of code behind saying if then else is very structured very ordered with AI you can ask it whatever you want you have to start thinking a little bit more broadly about how you're going to secure that so understand that the industry overall is building some very discreet and unique solutions maybe a little bit different from what we've had in the past but don't just presume that your standard the security solutions are going to be sufficient enough to protect those assets AI models applications and chatbots So there is some new tech out there that you need to at least be aware of and consider that as part of improving your posture should you be looking to implement AI Right Okay So we talked about a little bit about the technological um controls to embed trust Um there's also the human factor which uh Stephen you talked about earlier very quickly about accountability the importance of accountability frameworks governance right um can you share with our audience you know uh maybe one or two advice around designing those kind of frameworks because it's very complex topic right yeah I mean standardization and governance is critical I mean one one of the problems we have in this industry new technology starts you know there's a whole bunch of companies here in the room and what will happen is if there is money in your business and hopefully I pray for all of you you're successful the criminals will gravitate towards you because that's where the money is and in response what happens is you will all buy point solutions to deal with particular problems so governance of many point solutions and standardizations is very very difficult and hackers take advantage of that that's a huge problem if you have many many point solutions it's hard to have consist consistent compliance standardization governance etc And that's been the historic problem of security You know you want a common framework It's critical Okay So that helps with governance uh sorry governance So you will start to see I mean this particular organization who Carl works for ourselves we talk about moving towards standard platforms because it removes blind spots Okay So that's important The other thing I want to flag here I think it relates to What's very interesting in this industry there's been millions upon millions upon millions There are so many zeros uh in this number spent on keeping the bad people out Okay where has it gotten us I think what we need to be is a little bit realistic and pragmatic The fact of the matter is it doesn't matter how many million dollars you spend It's only a matter of time you will be compromised Okay it just depends how bad So it speaks to resilience So you know keep them out is a great mantra to have and you should try to keep hackers out But the reality is there's a chance someone will get in So the next question is if they're in how quick can you identify someone's in to stop them This is far more important So in Pedro's line is it's a malicious payment How do you stop and block it In our case if someone's in your environment how do you identify it quickly and stop it This is highly critical Most organizations and governments around the world now are not even aware they've been compromised and the hacker may be in the environment not days but actually weeks and months So understand they're in and how to stop And the last part is as coming back to close the loop around AI is visibility You got to have absolute visibility of the infrastructure to allow governance The challenge we have now with AI there are all these applications being launched and many of you don't even know what your employees are actually using And that's a fact and you should be concerned about that because they're uploading data They're using generative AI applications They're doing all sorts of wonderful things to uh increase productivity but they're probably sharing information they should not be sharing And they're not being malicious They just don't know that they're doing that because their boss has said to them \"Hey deadines tomorrow Carl Make sure you give me that paper and it better be a good damn slide deck with animation.\" Okay All right That's what we're dealing with So yeah Yeah Tomorrow Yeah Tomorrow Right I'm sure the conversation can go on for a lot longer but you know we have only 30 seconds left So in the last 30 seconds if I could invite each uh panelist to you know uh one quick takeaway for our audience come and chat to Cisco All right Okay AI has immense potential Don't be scared of it Excellent And I can say that uh there was a time where people thought that you have to have models that were either good or trustworthy and transparent But I think you you can have both So we are happy to work with regulators and uh governments and we have been seeing that in practice it is completely possible feasible realistic attainable to actually have models that are doing a great job in production but they are also transparent they have good governance uh information you you can describe the data the model so you can have the cake and the cherry on top and and eat it too Excellent So um yes uh so I hope that uh that gives you uh food for thought you know when you embark on your AI journey So thank you very much uh to our panelists",
