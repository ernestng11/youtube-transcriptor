    "aggregated_text": "i'm just from GFTN Uh we are a glo global not for-p profofit that brings together the public and the private sectors to advance inclusion and responsible innovation in financial services It's my pleasure to host these three to talk about AI in finance Let's start with introductions Kenneth Sure Hi good morning everyone It's lovely to be here at the super AI My name is Kenneth Gay I'm the chief fintech officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore Um so my role at the MEES is really to you know work together with the industry uh to advance you know uh finance and technology uh uh sectors in Singapore So MEES in case you guys don't know we we are the financial regulator At the same time we're also the central bank for Singapore right right we manage monetary policy uh via the uh exchange rate the Singapore dollar On top of that we also have a mandate to grow the financial sector in Singapore And this is you know the part of the organization that I'm at Um AI uh is a really big part of our growth agenda for the financial sector Uh we'll share I'll share later on but I see a lot of interest you know uh among Singapore financial institutions startups uh in in adopting AI and we work very closely uh with them I also have a passion for AI I'm a AI developer myself Spend my uh spare time however little I have uh trying to you know work with the latest models the latest frameworks and having a lot of fun in that process as well So really happy to be here Thank you Kenneth Rajiv You're one of the coolest titles I've seen Please do share Thanks Jess Um my name is Rajie I my title very unique Uh I always get that question Head of generative AI and future of work Why uh I work for DBS Um and why uh this long title is because at DBS we're convinced generative AI is going to change the way work gets done So that's why generative AI how do you transform the organization with generative AI but at the same time what will the future of work look like and combining all those two uh things So I've been with DBS for the last 10 years and before that 10 years in consulting u in Europe and in Singapore uh and now uh leading the task force to transform uh the organization through generative AI I'm not a technical person so I don't write Python on my spare time uh but I there from a strategy and transformation perspective Thank you Rajie Annabelle Um hi everybody My name is Annabelle and uh I lead the public policy team um for Southeast Asia as well as strategic engagement um at AWS Um so what I do at AWS is basically engage with governments regulators um uh customers as well all across the the Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific region and talk to them about policy issues of the day um understand some of their concerns um their worries about technology and then try and find ways in which um we can then work with regulators and governments to build frameworks together and address that Um I've been at AWS uh 6 years um and before that um I was also a regulator I was um part of the Singapore government um uh working on privacy regulations um and also wrote um the first AI model governance framework for Singapore back in the day in IMDA So um AI has been I think part of um my policy journey for the last uh oh it's almost 10 years now 8 years um and uh and um we've been um we've seen such a change and such an evolution um and I think it's it's understandable that as we get very very excited about innovation um there are also concerns very very legitimate concerns that are being raised by regulators and governments everywhere and I think if we can't hit the right balance between responsible use of AI and innovation then it will never get used right i think that's how it is right so so um that's my mission personally um just because of where I'm from um at AWS Um you know really happy to see many customers as well in this room building on AI Um we've done a lot to try and help our customers be able to meet whatever requirements that they have for responsible AI and that of course includes the financial services sector which is as we were just discussing highly regulated as well So thank you Annabelle I think that's a very very good way to start Now the journey of AI we've discussed a lot on this stage yesterday the evolution of AI through the flows of hardware software and data from expert systems to identifying patterns to predicting what's going to happen next to then generating uh content all forms of content and we stand at the cusp of agentic AI but how has this been mirrored by AI and Annabel you know gave us a bit of a precursor to the financial services regulated uh part of the industry uh maybe starting with you Kenneth know from your perspective as someone who's built AI who's now in MAS how have you seen this evolution of AI in financial services nuanced to the industry sure So if you look at the history of of AI and the history of finance actually the two are quite uh intertwined even you know like uh many a few decades ago in the 1990s actually the financial sector was an early adopter of AI uh and they used it back then you know to to carry out fraud detection and monitoring early form of AI machine learning network analysis and so on uh and fast forward to today the difference that we see now is that AI you know has become much more pervasive the use cases are much broader uh in nature So the challenge there of course is that uh as as you know uh uh my panelists have have noted uh financial sector is heavily regulated you know in pretty much every country and especially so in Singapore Uh we we take uh you know regulation very seriously uh because we actually view this as a competitive advantage for Singapore you know uh financial firms want to come to Singapore they want to get regulated here because they know that it is it is a positive so-called like signal you know for them to better serve the financial sector but that what that means for AI is that you know any type of use case especially if it's external customerf facing uh that needs to go through a lot of risk assessment uh a lot of engagement with the regulator a lot of guard rails being built in all the age cases we have to put them through you know a lot of different tests uh in order to to give the regulator later enough so-called assurance right what that means on one hand is that perhaps you may see you know AI adoption may not move as fast you know at least on the customerf facing end in the financial sector compared to other sectors but what that also means is that I think the financial sector has a lot of potential you know to actually be a good test bit a good innovation ground for uh building so-called safety uh correct outcomes for AI because this is an area where natively all the stakeholders involved have a very strong interest right in ensuring you know the right safe type of output So so that's in a nutshell what I see for the financial sector Thanks Kenneth I think on the panel a good thing to note we have the three key forces behind adopting AI We have policy finance and tech So we heard from the policy angle Let's go to finance and tech and maybe bringing you Rajie into the discussion From your perspective how have you seen this adoption of AI evolve uh you know from your days at at DBS and from before as well so it's a journey So uh at DBS as K was mentioning AI has been in the financial services industry for for for a very long time but I think in DBS uh our where we started to double down on AI was in 2018 where at the time from the top management we said we want AI to be pervasive across the whole organization We wanted to reduce time to value So it used to take 18 months to build uh use cases from idea to uh deployment and we wanted to drive economic outcomes Um in order to do this we said we're going to do three things We need to review our tech platforms We need to review our processes including governance and how we're going to deploy this responsibly and we had to uh uh have a people angle Yeah So so that was our three focus area On the people side there was one part which was more technical how you bring all the analytics the data community together But uh we look at it from a transformation perspective So how do um you get data in the DNA of the whole organization how do people think data first when anything they do they think data Be it control tower be it I launch a new product how do I um uh uh uh instrument data up front so uh and that started in 2018 So what we managed to do is that we have 300 over 50 use cases,500 models uh in production We and it's pervasive across corporate bank retail bank finance risk across the whole organization Two is we reduce time to value to two to three months to build use cases And finally uh we in our annual report last year we said we we drove $750 million of economic outcomes and uh this year we're going to surpass the billion dollar But all that journey so far was focused on traditional a IML So uh 2023 came genai So we said we have we believe we have a competitive advantage So let's build on on that to drive scale So we use the same principles is how do we drive value from generative AI how do I industrialize this across the organization i make access to LLM in a safe way So I build a platform where every use case can you use the same platform to build on top Very importantly how do I scale this responsibility it comes with new risks Uh so uh how do I do this and finally it's a people business So how do I bring our employees along the transformation journey but how also let the customers know what is happening so those are all the questions we're trying to crack Thank you Rajie Annabel Um I mean I think from a technology perspective so often we like to think about positive flywheels Um and if I think back to 2016 I remember sitting in rooms in Singapore with um with like financial services industry with banks with insurers as well And people were asking at the time like why should I even do anything with data like I I don't want to use data I don't want to share data I'm collecting data for a very narrow purpose and that's all I want to do with it and that that's it you know um and we fast forward say 2 years after that and um I think that's when uh there was a very big I would say well we thought it was a hype cycle it definitely did not die down so a very big interest um uh in the use of traditional AI um and a lot of people at the time were saying well really um now that we have the compute power um thanks to cloud service providers including AWS now that we have the compute power um we can do a lot more with data suddenly the possibilities look very very interesting but I think it really wasn't until um generative AI uh just about now really only 24 months ago um that I think that impact of AI and what AI can actually do beyond just you know basic um you know big data analytics um really I think for the men on the for the average consumer they suddenly understood what the impact of AI was and um if I look at it from a technology perspective that cycle shortening because now you know we went from maybe about uh 4 years to 2 years and now within the last 6 months um we're seeing so much um excitement and interest around aentic AI um and obviously it's a it's a bu you know we're seeing it build on top of you know traditional AI now generative AI and the next stage of course is is agents and being able to go out there ask your agent to do the search but then actually action for it um on it for you Um and so I think we see the technology evolution and and how companies organizations individuals are adopting that Um it's always going to be a slight lag time but I think depending on the industry um uh the the lag time varies right and actually I think for financial services despite being very heavily regulated We've seen um financial institutions often being forwardleaning in wanting to adopt technology I say that for a few reasons one I think they have a lot of shareholders who are staring at them very carefully um it's a very competitive space so you know if your if your competing bank decides to do this you might want to do something as well um but also because of the rise of um the fintex right the fintex in a lot of ways were were native and so they they move faster in in in certain ways obviously still regulated um but it it did create a big wave in in the um in the FSI sector so um actually I think we've seen a lot of adoption in FSI sector I think the Japanese um FSA the financial services um a authority actually did a survey and found that 90% of um Japanese uh FSIs are already adopting some kind of AI um probably more on the traditional side as you pointed out Uh and then um in Hong Kong the regulators have actually found that um you know the banks 75% of their banks um are already adopting um genai at least one genai use case So I think it's that kind of momentum that's really really important to keep up and from a technology perspective Um how do we balance that in a safe environment so I think there a lot of sandbox examples lower risk use cases to just get an understanding of what the technology is what it can do Um and then from there actually then building the policy and regulatory frameworks that are appropriate for those technologies So it's really exciting I I see the cycle going and I think for a gentic AI that's when we'll see really the commercialization the full commercialization model for genai actually like play out in aentic AI as well Thank you Annabelle I think coming back to you Kenneet So of course within MAS you're also trying to see how you can use you know AI genai in your use cases but also of course from the regulatory perspective looking at the industry Maybe do share with the audience a bit about how you're using it internally but also how you're seeing it being used within uh the Singaporean financial services industry Sure So let me start first with what we're doing within uh MEES for generative AI So for background uh prior to taking on this uh fintech role uh my previous role was uh in MES was doing internal uh data and digital transformation where I helped to build some of the applications that you know my colleagues actually use in MEES today Um so the first use case I would say very similar to DBS and in fact many other banks and and financial institutions that I speak to as well many of them want an internal version of a GBT Why because they deal with sensitive uh information uh their compliance their risk will want to have some kind of oversight some kind of assurance over where that information goes Uh so what we did at MEES was that uh we we actually you know use uh a so-called uh a selfhosted you know LM and which we a few in fact and and we keep upgrading them uh over the years I still remember the early days for those of you who may recall you know Bikunia was one of the first few you know that came up and then some of the meta models after that in between you know uh some some uh other models uh as well uh so so we keep iterating experimenting to see which uh so-called set of models best fit you know our colleagues use cases and we combine that you know with a variety of uh retrieval or metal generation tools connected to our information stores uh you know MES like other financial institutions have lots of internal information So we needed to undergo this kind of inventorization process categorizing our different types of information figure out what's the right data classifications you know so that helped us to actually broaden the benefits of generative AI uh in the first instance for the typical type of like broad chat GPT use case Uh another use case internally that uh we we find to be quite helpful uh is in the area of horizon scanning and risk surveillance So uh what uh I did in MES was that I actually built like a information pipeline uh where we work with news aggregators to pump you know news information into a centralized uh so-called like uh repository and and u a message feed if you will This message feed then allows us to be able to uh monitor news over a certain time horizon find out what are the key implications and then summarize them for our stakeholders So every day uh the the the management in ME has actually received so-called a set of news alerts you know that come up automatically in the morning when they wake up they get to see what's the top uh information that's relevant to them So this is another use case that we've built and we've also built some tooling uh that allows the colleagues or colleagues within the organization as well uh to interface you know with a with a type of a chatbot uh to to to actually uh customize some of the alerts that they want to receive based on their topics Uh so now that's for me coming now to financial institutions quickly Uh I would say for generative AI the use case is in a few categories Of course the general productivity use cases like what I shared A lot of them are also thinking quite hard about how they can improve the customer service experience using generative AI right a lot of them want to think about you know can I use like uh text to to uh speech to text or multimodel so-called like uh uh uh uh uh models to actually uh improve their ability to understand the what the customer wants to be able to retrieve you know relevant past uh interactions with the customer so that they can actually better serve the customer That's one set of use case I also see a lot of interest in research analysis type uh use cases Quite a few there have employ agentic frameworks to actually retrieve you know uh information from different stores orchestrate uh the the the research process and come up with something that allows again you know the banks to serve you know their internal or external uh uh stakeholders better as well Yeah Thanks Thank you Kenneth DBS GBT Rajiv do share with the audience how you've internalized and and you know brought this out to the market So so at DBS we have two categories of use case What we call horizontal which is uh unlocking the power of generative AI for uh and unstructured data just remember what's unstructured data with generative AI for all our employees and verticals which are use cases that will tackle specific personas So from a horizontal so DBS GPT very similar to what uh MAS um uh does uh is your general uh uh tool we can change models uh we keep upgrading the models to the latest versions from any family of models uh we'll give you rewrite summarize transcribe uh type of uh capabilities but also access to company knowledge So how do uh how to retrieve this so we get our GPT to connect to multiple sources But u on a horizontal basis one of the learnings is garbage in garbage out So if you index all we thought should we index all our shareepoints all our storage across the board But then we quickly realized like if you have outdated information or conflicting information and also within the quality of so the the whole governance process that we set up to on board knowledge to make sure the quality uh is there but why is horizontal use case important You see ideas of use cases that come up So uh everyone start using it and they each have their own way of using it Then you find an idea in one area in uh um in our cash management team uh before they go meet clients They they they uh ingest uh annual reports and uh ESG reports of the company and they have uh they've built a long prompt to find talking points of discussion points with the customer then say oh they do it there why can't you do it in another area of the bank so it's it's an idea generation So the impact might be not so deep but uh uh the idea generation is is very rich And then the second category of use case are verticals where when we started in uh 23 to build some initial use case uh and in 24 we realized lots of those use cases were fantastic because we learn about the technology but the depth of it was you know it saves you 3 minutes there or 2 minutes there which basically the impact is very minimal You don't see deep impact So we said we need to really focus on certain personas and and go deep So build use case on top of each other Um uh if you take uh call centers um it helps you uh live transcript access to knowledge automatically Knowledge comes to you instead of going to look for it It summarize it uh uh automatically and it generates a service request when needed So the outcome of it is um the customer service officer can have more in-depth conversation with the customer So we can focus on the resolution doesn't need to scribble or or toggle many many screens So the the the the quality of the interactions have improved the the percentage of resolution uh has increased in the first time resolution rates Um and we save time so the the it makes the CSOS more more efficient But we have hundred over use cases across the organization in operations how you can scan a document and extract information to to pre-input some information to technology to uh assisting uh coders to to uh in in uh code generation to uh testing uh uh scenarios use case scenarios to supporting our RMS to have more meaningful conversation to making some of the admin work of our front lines less tedious So uh it's quite broad-based in terms of types of use cases Many more to come Thank you Rajie Annabelle from your perspective what are the key enablers and and moving to blockers very soon but starting with enablers first What have you seen enable these sort of transformations um I mean I think overall probably the biggest enabler is being able to have I think on on one level the top down support right and push um but on the other level also I think at a broad level um making sure that your teams and I think we spoke a little bit about this um are thinking actively about how to use AI so almost like a grassroots buildup of what are these AI use cases and I think you touched on that in your horizontal approach um and look we've seen that I mean Amazon obviously we've used AI as a for for a long time Um and I mean I think the enablers are simply the technology exists now Um the CEOs basically told everyone go and figure out how you should use AI in your jobs We have S team goals Um so senior leadership team goals um for I think at least the trailing tree is now that is like how are you using generative AI in your work Um what are the new programs that you want to put in place in each organization within Amazon to to be more efficient So I think that top down push is really really helpful but the bottom up push as well getting people trained and understanding what AI is So now for all of us regardless of whether you're in a technical or non-technical role at AWS you need to go and get um uh you know uh AI cloud certification so you understand what is the technology what is the art of the possible with the technology um you know we we're lucky to have people who can develop applications for us if we can think of it you know so so so really just having that kind of um thinking about the use cases having people understand the technology well enough to come together and actually propose what that use case is and then work with the development teams to build it So we're we're in quite a lucky position and I would say those are the enablers right making sure that you have that open um culture of adopting technology um and also having that push from the top down but also having the the kind of capacity building and training from the bottom up to be able to come together and find those use cases Um that's within an organization I think external to an organization the probably the key enabler is um knowing uh having that regulatory certainty knowing that you can do these um you know use cases you can implement these use cases without running a file of a regulatory requirement um and I think that's where MAS has done an amazing job at ensuring that the conversations are ongoing where there are higher risk case use cases there are sandboxes that people can experiment in as well but I think that's that's probably across across all industries as well needing to have that sort of regulatory clarity and certainty Um and then kind of the broad guard rails around responsible use of AI balance again is innovation again right so helping people learn about how they should it's gets complicated I think when you're thinking when you're basically empowering individuals um to build these use cases to propose them so having the right governance structure having the right people asking the questions of um how do we make the judgment call as to whether this use case is risky will there be downstream impact and having that be um a a multifunctional crossunctional group that's not only the technologists um not only the lawyers not only the compliance people but all of them together and probably throw in some ethics people and and social science people into the mix to to make those um decisions and make those calls because I think the challenge is um the technology always wants to innovate the the the lawyer or the compliance person always wants to you know minimize risk and um and uh and you know um the ethicist or the social scientist is thinking about the big picture questions but it's very rarely actually deep in the technology So having all those people come together and try and make those decisions I think it's a it's a big enabler for companies as well We we have that Amazon too So we're lucky that way Thank you Annabelle I think we'll double click on two of the things she mentioned but also do keep your questions ready So shortly we'll come to the audience Q&A section as well Uh so double clicking on two parts One the policy and the people side We starting with the policy first I think she alluded to the leadership of MAS in creating the guardrails I think project mind force the feed principles and many others Maybe do share Kenneth and of course coming to you Rajie next as one of the leading banks who worked on these projects How has that experience been in building these guard rails or enabling the industry to balance innovation and oversight yeah So so I think from MES's perspective we really see it as an example of firstly you know consulting the industry and moving beyond that to collaborating with the industry When we first started you know our own uh AI uh governance journey you know back in 2018 2019 you know we we we just had a few ideas in mind that we wanted to share with the industry right ai should be fair it should be ethical uh financial institutions should be accountable for their outcomes and there should be transparency So we say okay we we strung them together and say feed right f a t you know and we put out you know these broad guidance just as a starting point to the financial industry you know to to get their feedback you know uh and and for us to iterate on this uh together uh so so what happened after that is that we started hearing a lot of uh uh uh feedback from financial institutions how do I adopt it you know these principles uh within my institution so after that we then came up with uh so-called a feed so-called like a toolkit you know a kind of a open source toolkit that financial institutions could take you know and run in their own adapt and run in their own institutions Uh this is this is soal like the more traditional machine learning type uh model so that they can uh assess it you know for on some indicators of you know bias uh uh uh ethics and and other you know uh uh uh areas as well fairness Uh so that's the next step of the journey uh after that when generative AI came on the scene uh the financial institutions we already formed this community of practice already and the community asked so so generative AI is now on the scene what should we think about next how do we think about the risk and that that was where project mindge came about uh MES again brought the industry together and we said how do we have this kind of explainer approach you know on what the key uh explaining the generative AI technology explaining at a broad level what the risk could be and explaining at a broad level you know what sort of considerations that a financial institution could have So from there we released a white paper you know uh uh back uh last year and this year what we're doing then is we're trying to double click on that Now financial institutions are at the stage of actually uh building and deploying generative AI applications They want more clarity around you know what sort of uh specific features their guardrail should have what are the specific considerations you know for these teams So on that front we're trying to develop that into a playbook this year uh that we hope that uh uh uh institutions across different segments of the financial sector whether it's banking insurance capital markets we try to gather the key use cases uh then we try to gather the key so like risk considerations for those and see how far we can push on this front in order to give them um clarity in terms of what they should consider in deploying their applications Yeah thank you Can a very good example of the public private collaboration across policy finance and tech Rajie bringing you into this uh discussion So uh the trade-off that we always need to do is innovation vs risk So and um we work very closely with uh the regulators especially in Singapore with MAS and all is how do you take a risk based approach based on principles rather than uh locking in uh regulation that will prevent innovation So keep it fluid because we're all learning as we go right So the technology keeps evolving at a pace uh never seen before So finding that sweet spot is very hard So uh and we are financial services So trust is at the center of everything for our with our customer They give us their money to safekeep So it's really important So we need to take uh uh uh really good care of uh the trust but also finding the balance between governance and speed of innovation So internally we always people tell us why are you stopping me from doing stuff uh but that that's the that that that's the feedback that many people uh tell us or yesterday I I was going through some questions we receive in some town halls on why cannot use tool A tool B or whatever but to bring on a tool safely within an organization make sure the data doesn't get leaked that data sovereignty is respected uh that the IP uh of our data isn't being used to train another model uh contractually that we we we have the the clauses it takes time and effort So we need to pick and choose the right tools that we want to on board Uh but once on boarded everyone can use So finding that balance between innovation and risk is uh critical and then we review every single use case before they go um into production So it's a risk based approach So some lower risk use case versus higher risk use case will have different hurdles But maybe I I want to uh the talk a little bit about the people aspect M so it's a transformation So we have 41,000 uh employees How do we bring those 41,000 employees uh uh within the this journey so the when I started my role in 23 end of 23 we had um um uh transformation festival where we showcase all our innovation Um the the feedback the the tone of the questions I was getting was what is this technology will it have an impact for me there was a bit of a fear tone When we did the same festival end of 24 there was a different tone It was a sense of excitement So when is this tool coming to me i can see the benefit of it in my uh uh uh day life Why can't I have it uh within my organization so so we see that so the effort we put in to work with our uh colleagues to from the top management to and when we roll out use cases to wide uh uh um uh communications and trainings to the whole organization as Anabel was saying it's not just data professionals it's the whole organization needs to transform we also been uh transparent that it will change the way work gets done ya job today might might be a bit different tomorrow uh and as I we were rolling out DBS GPTs Someone um came to me and says \"Hey your GPT doesn't work.\" I asked him \"What document should I bring to my uh customer meeting?\" I said \"If it was a new colleague coming in how would you ask that question?\" So I'm a treasures RM I'm going to meet a customer at for uh uh uh investment product or whatever product you are say ask the question in that way He typed the question uh and then he got a perfect answer So what I mean is it's a new skill that we need to ensure people understand how to use this technology It's not just uh random question without context So transforming uh uh that is important and the second part uh so upskilling our people The second part is we're thinking of operating model If one of the premise of this technology is access to knowledge is democratized What would your organization look like i I think it would look very differently So simple example uh we have two call center one for corporate bank one for consumer bank Tomorrow could there be uh uh uh you a customer makes a call and answer a corporate or retail customer if the information is at your fingertips Same thing from a branch uh corporate we have corporate branches retail branches So we are not there yet but that's the way we're thinking How would the organization operating model look like going forward um thanks Rajie I think mentioned a few very important points I think yesterday in a session there was a talk about techno HR functions and and bringing the human and the AI agent in the future together into one function bringing Annabelle and Kenneth into this maybe starting with you Annabel the future of machine human collaboration you know do share your thoughts and add on to what Rajie mentioned yeah I mean absolutely and I think we already um we're already seeing that right we're already working with AI so we already have some initial data points um for example um uh we've we've heard from customers um that as they use as their coders as their developers use um like code whisper which is AWS's version of helping you write code um what they're starting to see is a change in the behavior of how the developer interacts with his colleagues as a result of having um code whisperer generate that first first first first card of code um and it's very very fascinating because um so I think one of the one of the stories that I've heard is so typically if you're a junior developer you come in you're writing code you're maybe not great at it yet um your senior comes and you know come and comes and helps you maybe like says oh this could be improved this could be more efficient um but obviously cuz you wrote that code you're going to be a lot more defensive of it right you know there's a bit of ego there You're like \"No I disagree You know maybe this.\" And and so and so what apparently has happened is that now that first version of code the very rough draft that's maybe not perfect is being generated by AI And suddenly you as the junior developer you're coming in no longer as the guy who's just written that first draft and is getting a bit defensive but as the person who's critiquing that version of code that Gai has produced So now you're you're actually kind of moving up the the the skills chain a little bit You're not so focused on just creating that first copy but you're actually um looking at how to improve it And you're now able to have a discussion with your seniors about that efficiency of this code that was written and how it could be improved And the senior is coming in less of a critique now Um and that relationship is less defensive and it's more open and you're you're then collaborating better And that's just a very very fascinating example We see that with developers We also see that with like for me I'm a policy writer so I I write as well and that has really really helped the process of actually being able to critique and push writing to the next level Um because you're no longer the one having to sit there with a blank page trying to write something that you know people are going to you know tear apart later or criticize later So it really shifts the mindset of how you're being productive but also what your job actually entails Um and I think we're going to we don't know yet right we don't we don't fully see all the use cases but I think having a good mechanism to be able to collect these data points and having the organizations prepare for that I think DBS has done an amazing job having a future work um role and function because part of that is also understanding how the job is actually changing um and and what that means for the the person right because this is ultimately a people problem Um and I think in some ways it can be positive and in other ways it could be challenging and negative right if people aren't willing to upscale if they're if they're pushing back against the technology that is coming that's going to be a very very different kind of conversation So how do you build that into your mechanism collect that data points and and help with employee sentiment and and you know kind of um employee productivity as well So I think that's a big conversation I feel I'm not the expert here You probably are speaking to that but I think that's just a couple of data points we've already Thank you Before I bring Kenneth in we're running short on time so I'll I'll get his views but maybe do keep your questions ready We'll have runners in the in the audience with with any questions that you might have Maybe very quickly 20 seconds 20 seconds Uh future of human AI interaction I think we'll see a lot more clarity uh in terms of our work processes Uh you see it in coding whereby you know sure you guys here do bite coding right if you just give it a few lines or one or two lines the code's not going to be that great But if you set it to work you know over a code repository where all your readmes your coding conventions you know your system spec design considerations are there the code is going to come out better right and you can do you know automated you know testing and and stuff like that as well Similarly in the policy space uh having exposing you know uh the AI to a broader pool of information having the standard authoring procedures there having the perhaps some of the the team practices work processes inside there is also going to improve not only the AI but also new joiners to the team as well Thanks Do we have time for a question one question maybe please Uh any runner in the audience uh with the mic uh I think there time for maybe one or two questions over there Hi Uh my name is KZ from uh KBTG from Bangkok Uh I just want to ask like uh about the use case agentic AI use case So what is the potential of the agentic AI use case for the financial and banking is there any like customerf facing one that going to happen soon thank you Maybe only time for the one question but viewers on agentic before we close the panel So so agentic AI is there u and there are different spectrum of agentic AI and I think um Kenneth said uh customerf facing from a banking perspective we need trust and we are highly regulated So one wrong answer will cause a lot of trouble for for forganization So um I think those are building blocks that you you will use to get towards a customerf facing agent that will answer some questions but I think uh a fully autonomous customerf facing uh agent I don't think from a banking perspective we are there yet we need to do uh co-pilots first then expose simple uh knowledge then you'll build simple transaction more queries on your transactions then you'll build uh uh uh on top of that maybe potentially a lowrisk advisory But all these are building blocks you need to uh uh build to get that security before you you can fully open to to to more a wider spectrum of use cases Any quick remarks from either of you i think similar we'll see probably customer agents being the first kind of um use case or the the like low hanging fruit use case is what we'll call it where I think organizations can very quickly trial that already Um AWS has uh and and many of our partners have offered these services already Um I think what will be really fascinating so Amazon just announced Alexa plus in the US So Alexa is um as many of you probably are aware um is is the u uh voice assistant Um so you buy a little speaker it talks to you Um and Alexa Plus now has the ability for um certain agentic capabilities as well So you can now tell Alexa plus to potentially buy something for you from Amazon when it runs out or you could potentially ask them to book a ticket for you And so I think we're seeing more and more of that um agents in sort of your daily lives as a consumer Um and then I think internally in operations um we're also actively thinking about how we can actually get more agents in there to maybe um uh minimize or remove some of the more mundane or operational tasks that you know the average employee has to do like file claims for example or you know um um book book flights like if you don't have to do that yourself or scheduling if you can push that out to an agent then you know everybody gets more efficient and more productive So I think these are some of the initial use cases we'll see but but I'm very excited We're very we're just at the start Yeah So just very quickly um AI is really being used for customerf facing uh applications but the responses they are very tightly controlled and predetermined you know so so you need to map that very carefully and that's why a lot of times you see uh when you interact with a chatbot uh normally you have to select from a certain set of questions and the responses are controlled from there Uh so so this is a broader issue about agentic AI Those of you who built uh agentic systems will know it's actually very hard to control the the output you know and a lot of times you have to actually constrain the output first so that you can have some happy paths and then after that you explore the edge cases from there and exactly as what Rajiv said I think we actually have to go on this journey to build trust amongst all the stakeholders so that we can actually see agentic uh AI customerf facing applications in future thank you so much I'm afraid we're out of time thank you so",
