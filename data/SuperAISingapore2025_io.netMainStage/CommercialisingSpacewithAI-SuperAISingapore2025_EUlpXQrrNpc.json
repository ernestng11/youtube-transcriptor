interesting we're going to dive into the intersection of two domains that all of you know about which are AI and space but whose convergence is far less known um there has been many moments in the recent history of AI when artificial intelligence went out of labs and uh became something that people were talking about think about largecale expert systems in the past or the day when uh DBlau won over Kasparov in chess or the recent wave and hype of generative AI which is uh transforming uh how we live and work so much space technologies in turn might also be approaching a pivotal moment there are some indications of that for example uh many things are changing exponentially right now uh for example the number of satellites in orbit has gone up by the factor of 10 over the last years or uh the prohibitive cost of getting the payload to space has plummeted or we have so many startups and commercial companies in space so it feels like that this area is also going to be very very different already in a few years but the question is how can AI uh transform space technology and help it uh become even more usable bring more value to us on Earth and uh unlock new orbits so this is what we're going to talk about today uh we know the names of the panelists but let us start with a proper round of introductions please go one by one and tell us a little bit about uh who you are and what your company does hi I'm Dr imonguan and I'm a co-founder of Kumi Analytics uh Kumi Analytics like uh integrate AI and data uh satellite data uh to uh provide insight of economic and and environmental insights hi everyone my name is John i'm a co-founder of Nika uh which is a spatial computing company based out of Singapore our flagship product is Nikapanet which is essentially a data bricks for geoai uh some of the models type of models our customers build include climate infrastructure um as well as obviously satellite based models from imagery to sensory based models hi guys my name is Floyd Costa and I'm the co-founder of Space Armor we actually started out in cyber security but then since then we've assembled our own AI engine which we are now deploying on an NVIDIA Jetson card and launching it into space exploring uh you know in orbit edge AI use cases we're taking a platform approach but uh for us it's about how can we deliver AI for space in space hi everyone I'm Rohit uh and CEO and co-founder of Trans Celestial we build lasers in space we are using lasers to provide internet worldwide um we're building a giant undersea cable in space uh to power internet worldwide and then also starting next year data centers in space so if you're looking at virtual machines to to put your AI in space give us a shout amazing amazing what a great panel today so I suggest we start from making the whole concept of AI in space less theoretical but much more practical let us show to everyone that there are applications that are happening already right now uh it would be great if if each of you picks just one uh use case uh how you're already using AI how it helps in your business the satellite data is so rich i mean we have data all the way in the 80s and it has the whole world coverage um so our one of our product is SK set it um it is a measurement and validation uh product uh for uh to measure carbon stocks in forest uh before the carbon stock is register as carbon credits and so and so as carbon credits so this this product is um is used even from beginning of the um the project uh where where we work with project developer to to um to choose the project site and choose where the the project developer can measure um uh do ground measurements of the of the forest trees um so we use um satellite for land cover estimation to to identify whether a certain area has been deforested and not and cannot be used for um for the current credits uh project and to uh identify spots where the the ground measurements can be accessible for for measurements we from that we the settle data is very dirty like meaning is you have um atmospheric um uh noise so we do use AI to clean it up we use AI to remove the cloud and shadow and for that we do the measurements there's a lot of features a lot of different data from the satellite data and we fuse it and do the biomass measurements so these are quite a lot of AI that is algorithmic uh AI algorithms that use for for our product uh for us one clear use case uh is actually uh is actually the model our customer built our infrastructure um this is related to some work that they're doing for the Bahamas government where they're actually trying to utilize satellite imagery to actually predict why certain seaggrasses are actually um dying uh in this Bahamas in the Bahamas and the reason is because that's a huge uh importance to the government because that's where a lot of their tourism revenue comes from um so these are the type of models that are trying to predict and and determine why certain seaggrasses might be dying great for us like I mentioned we're taking more of a platform approach so what we have is our entire AI engine which will be hosted in space and I I I guess you know as down on earth we continue to rely more and more on space for a whole lot of services i think that's where we're looking at enabling AI in space just to give an example today if you even look at earth observation a lot of data is collected GBs of data and then sound sent down to earth and processed on the ground our take is that if you can just process that in space then you don't need to send all that data to ground on to the ground but instead of GBs of data you just send the 1 M of the 5 MB file for example that's what's really required the other case is also it goes stretches beyond if you look at climate impact or disaster warning systems again instead of sending that data down to ground and processing it and trying to uh trigger alerts you can process that in space itself and take away all the lag and the and latency and instantly broadcast threat alerts thereby trying you know being able to more efficiently basically deliver warnings to uh prevent loss of life or property just a few example but then it goes even beyond defense and further out there yeah um I just very quick there's three ways we use AI uh one is on a on a device level AI allows us to uh different kinds of machine intelligence but it allows us to beam lasers very accurately at long distances so for example last year we be beamed lasers from LA all the way to Palm Springs to provide internet for Coachella Music Festival so if you guys were streaming 4K videos of Coachella that was thanks to us second uh national uh sovereignity is not guaranteed anymore we have three major battles going on and bulk of that battle is being fought on the intelligence front and we are not talking about traditional intelligence with machine intelligence so one of our use cases is how um how our non-jamable communications which we use as lasers can effectively allow uh ship swarms and drone swarms to protect your borders to protect your citizens but also deter any kind of forces that want to take that sovereignity away and the final one is uh space transelestial as the name suggests uh we believe that humanity's v future is in the stars and we are building the telecommunication systems for us to go deeper to send one noman pure probes or similar kind of machine intelligence in deep space what is extremely critical to make that happen is data centers and connectivity and so it it's kind of like a mix and match of where we use AI and what kind of intelligences we use some are dumb AI some are smart AI but yeah it offers a lot of open uh capabilities to us yeah thank you thank you great um I feel there are so many uh use cases and the the whole range from incremental improvement of what you do anyway to unlocking new use cases is there but uh applying AI in the business environment is uh always tricky uh because there are so many uh difficulties uh to overcome uh the examples are availability of data yeah availability of uh compute and infra where you need it if you don't have time to send data to the server you need both uh uh compute facilities and energy uh where you are or if you use AI to make uh autonomous decisions you need to trust AI do you face uh any of these limitations in your work and if yes how do you overcome it uh yes definitely so we use Google uh cloud and um and AWS they have all the data set in their cloud storage um so so we can search the relevant data um some of the problems we have is the quality of the data that we use to train a model like um sometimes some data are not available like uh when the cloud and shadow is the missing data data and also because the what we are tracking um like for example carbon stocks the the the forest in different part of the world are so diverse and uh we have a lack of uh data for training um so there's um quite a lot of problems solve and also the computition complexity we there's the the AI algorithm is so rich there's so many types of u com combination we can use so we yeah so we have to work on uh optimizing the model and try to reduce the complexity like uh every pixel there be certain value do we need to store in like things like eight bits or four bits and stuff Right so there's a lot optimization to do uh before we move to John but would it be fair to say monk that for your company since it is directly in the analytics space AI is paramount without AI you just would not be able to deliver the quality and value that you deliver uh I don't think so no you don't think so yeah um because AI is um so powerful so it it it does uh provide um uh um better precision better quality of insight of of such a vast amount of data okay thank you John yeah uh one of the types of models that we've been building for our customers is flood risk models um for example in Bangkok flooding is a huge issue and satellite is a great use case uh in space technologies to actually help you to use historical data to understand the risk in certain areas but one of the inherent limitations of AI is that you're using primarily historical based data i think Dr man talked a lot about that to simulate these um kind of scenarios based on historical data i think kind of the next thing that we're really looking at is how can you do things better predictively which is still very very challenging at different times um because some of the simulation type algorithms are required for urban based analytics or spatial works is still very very nent so there's a lot of you know newer work to be done there and how we can further incorporate siliz based data to make those models a lot more robust you know to help things like insurance you know companies better predict some of these risks so you can better price their premiums for their customers thanks good point for us uh since we are operating space I think the base challenge that we have is the restrictions uh AI requires a lot of energy and then if you're operating on a small satellite then of course that that that amount of energy is not available tomorrow we will have new space stations being launched we'll have inorbit data centers where perhaps this then gets taken care of the other challenge is of course today we're looking at uh you know inference and stuff like that but tomorrow if you're looking at autonomous space uh uh you know autonomous decision being taken in space then I think the data which you know both of you guys mentioned plays a critical role how do you get that data into space so that whether it's robots or whether it's satellites or other u you know um uh objects that need to autonomously make decisions have the latest information and context not just the the large language model at the back end which they're using to take the decision so it's not just guardrails and things like that for hallucination but also the latest data and context bases which they can then take that decision mhm yeah it's it's a it's a tough one because we apply AI in so many places but I think the big one is you're seeing um pretty much all the market capture on the cloud AI side is uh the traditional like Gemini Cloud and OpenAI models gotten so good that for general purpose use cases the the incentive to run things on prem or on your server has gone away pretty much but the other side of the market which is I would argue orders of magnitude bigger and what we play in is defense national security and some of the more sensitive applications for that none of these cloud models ever work because they are optimized for the cloud so that's where you start looking at two key metrics cost per serve and latency per serve so if anyone's out here building solutions on AI and stuff I would strongly recommend you to not go for general purpose use cases but work with us and other companies here to understand how can you deliver better cost per serve and latency per serve to private customers like governments and defense which want to run these models inside their firewall inside on their prem and that's one of the challenges we we face so a year ago I invested in a small startup from Singapore called Featherless AI and they are now powering the engine behind hugging face where you can plug in like 5,000 different unique open source models that's the kind of capabilities people need to start thinking about and and what will be majority used and what we would love to use more and more yeah yeah very clear by the way do any of you envision uh using way more AI already in one two years so is the usage in your companies going up uh it's definitely going up so um we we there's uh as the as more as a enabling technology evolve and is more efficient and cheaper um and more algorithms uh targeting to um uh satellite images yeah we definitely see um doing using more AI um so we we um in like maybe three five years we we see more concentration of using satellite for ESG for precision agriculture for uh urban planning um that as as things get cheaper and more data is available uh for example algorithms are available in open source for example I I you know I I I'd like to add something which is slightly different so yesterday I was looking at the you know one of the speakers Pippa Malgrim from the geopolitical institute she spoke on a number of subjects but one which caught my attention was what she called texticity which is really the amalgamation of emerging tech where you've got things like uh AI you've got uh emerging uh financial ecosystem like you know uh decentralized finance you've got the whole you know blockchain powered systems and uh and and other emerging tools IoT and stuff which together are progressing I guess when it comes together you're going to see that real explosion where AI by itself is not going to deliver something but when it can tie in with some of these other emerging models some of these other modern approaches I think that's when you're going to see it going mainstream because then it becomes so much more easier where AI just be becomes something like the cloud which you use you really don't bother going underneath and trying to uh you know red uh you know trying to pick and uh choose middle underneath for example like the you know like the folks you said you've got 5,000 models there pick and choose but that then gets abstracted and once that happens I guess you're going to see that uh you know go mainstream alone it's a bit of sci-fi in our session I love it John Roit any any ideas on how AI usage can grow in the next years yeah I mean a a big one is I would like to thank all the VCs in this room for wasting their LP monies and giving us these free AI tools congratulations it's awesome What that has helped is has allowed me to like for example today we write 50% of code using AI and I spend zero extra dollars on my budget which is fantastic um and I think what's what's happening is from from leadership down uh I think for for a straight period of four months we have some of the coolest engineers in the company but they are stubborn as and so you have to stand on their heads and tell them that dude your KPI is to figure out how stop stop laughing and start looking at what parts of you and your team AI can actually truly bring in and solve right and unless and until as leaders you actually show like for me I I started spending my weekends we just uh launched our uh I would say like wbe trailer for trans celestial please go and check it out on YouTube it's a 1 minute trailer entirely built using V3 clips and I did it on my own after three glasses of whiskey so and I think things like that leaders have to show that they are willing to kind of step up and use AI tools themselves AI capabilities themselves like and I'm talking more about LLMs but then also for mission critical stuff right like all our pointing and tracking runs on like ondevice AI systems which are a mix of heruristics and large running models but effectively now we have capabilities which shoots a laser where we can shoot a laser from let's say Tokyo and hit this club cup of coffee in Singapore and this would not have been possible without machine intelligence so I think I think that's what you have to kind of unlock also for your team as a leader amazing john do you want to add anything yeah I'll just add in very quickly i mean as you said a big issue in AI in space is the lack of lack of data right honestly satellites haven't been up there for that long there's not that as many images as we would like um but this is increasing exponentially i mean you see he's sending satellites elon Musk is sending hund so there's going to be a huge data explosion which is already happening and that's only I think going to make AI more and more prevalent it's going to make these models a lot better once we overcome some of those issues yeah I I think it would be great to dive a little bit uh more into that because uh I assume the majority of the people in the audience uh know AI but know a bit less about space and uh it must be very interesting to be able to visualize what actually the infrastructure for AI for 100x or thousandx of AI that we have today in space needs to be because it feels like that there are a lot of limitations you probably need to have compute there in space you need to have enough energy how do you do get this energy so if you could talk a little bit explaining describing this future in simple terms that would be great who wants to start i can go first um because we we kind of are having these debates every day right now so what we will see is so you know the classic challenge when you put an IoT sensor how much do you collect at the edge and how much do you process versus how much do you send back and process at the center this has been a very classic back and forth so in space what's happening is all the earth observation all the military satellites they strike a balance between how much data they collect and how much they compute on board with uh more high bandwidth laser coms and data centers in space what's going to happen is they're going to offload all of that to centralized uh GPU clusters and stuff in space but there's two major challenges so very quickly what you would see Mark is um us getting to shifting compute and storage capabilities on centralized nodes like we did on earth but unlike on earth we have two major problems in space one is sun sun's energy is extremely weak and so we have to within we'll get to five to 10 kilowatts of data centers and then we will have a plateau there for a while until we can put small modular nuclear reactors and antimatter reactors up there so once you get that then you break the 50 megawatt barrier and you can start putting more stuff up there the second problem is heat space is cold but it's infinitely harder to cool things down in space because there is no air and so what do you do with that all of that additional heat which is already a problem for data centers here so there's a lot of cool innovations coming from on how to handle and handle that but I think these two are going to be we're going to quickly get quick benefits and we'll deploy some AI capabilities but we'll be restricted on energy and cooling until we can solve those two problems very quickly there are solutions but it will take bravery to get there yeah great perspective i want to add something to what you said and that's where uh probably take a different view on the centralized stuff right so I was having a chat with uh I don't know if he's here a new acquaintance I met and one of the things ideas is he's asking if we can get his idea is to get a robot on the moon now of course for whatever the purpose is you want to use intelligence there and he's like can your artificial intelligence then be used for that system and yes it does make sense but that got me thinking if I'm on a satellite or in orbit on a space ation how do we connect and deliver intelligence with real-time update and context on the moon for example because again the it's a hostile environment you want fewer humans and probably more uh robots doing the job there right but then those robots need to autonomously take decisions just like a human would do so how can you give them the intelligence but also provide the real-time context and that becomes interesting today like you rightly mentioned Rohit everything is centralized and these are servers sitting in data centers and things like that but one interesting thing and I know there are a few guys talk already talking about is decentralized AI and is there a way to distribute the computing so that some of it is computed in space some of it is or or at the edge and then the rest computed centrally and then the moment you have that you can kind of and and again you can decentralize it and distribute it in space but also from space to ground and that opens infinite uh possibilities amazing i'm just going to talk about a little bit more of a maybe practical kind of um thing that I see like uh you know that's very people might be able to understand a lot easier um I just think there's a not enough talent in our space to actually I think deliver the type of 100,000x that we see and it's very simple i'll be really honest the type of code that we that we do is quite different from what your traditional LLM can typically handle um it's a lot more complex a lot more computationally intense a lot of times it requires PhDs to actually who understand these type of um very complex type of algorithms and the a huge limitation for me to actually even reach that stage is I don't it's very hard for us to find talent um even even then a lot of them are you know um at much larger American startups as well um you know doing amazing things for NASA as well you know these are just I'll say practical limitations for us to continue to in innovate at that space though I think there there's a lot of other exciting things I think we might see um you know to reach that 100 100,000 X but we need a lot more talent a lot more AI type talent cool anything to add um definitely there's a lot of lack of talent and um what the skill set is required to to to commercialize certain products um yeah I mean uh edge computing is getting popular how we how we can uh commercialize uh all this data as a age computing uh applications that's um we need a lot still need a lot of imaginations and uh I think not many have grasps the the potential yet for using AI with space um space uh based data yeah I now have a very very practical question about the future of AI in space imagine uh a 5 to 10 year timeline what is more likely that uh um in five seven 10 years we will still process the majority of information we get from space on earth so we obviously will get uh much more information that we're getting today will we keep mostly transmitting it to Earth and use smart AI here or will the future already in 10 years be about much more AI in space autonomous systems and making decisions right there who would bet on what yeah I mean again some some of some of the solutions we're developing now think about that uh we absolutely need to bring so today we are starting to build optical ground stations worldwide in key data centers and key cities uh so Singapore Barcelona Australia Texas uh Japan and a few places what this allows us to do is mainly government and defense use cases and these are all postquantum cryptography secured nodes what this allows us to do is like very secure let's say embassy data foreign affairs data uh intelligence data you you you want to kind of bring it down because effectively you want the last mile to be people making those calls do we fire this missile or not right there is a human element to that that you always want that done but we are also on the on the other hand there's a lot of deterrence and stuff that can be done from space for example one of our first use cases of a data center in orbit is the ability to put an AI which can use non-jamable lasers to an autonomous swarm of drones in high orbit uh and can coordinate uh offensive and defensive capabilities that is best left to AI in orbit uh to drive in in one sentence where will the majority of data be processed space data on Earth or in space oh like by far in space by far yeah your your bet Floyd space is so much more vast and there's so much more we don't know right just like in AI so it has to be in space okay John I would agree in space but I still think there's going to be a large amount that's processed uh on on Earth depending on where the cost leaves the on Earth because of the cost wow if you can the energy thing there and and you know we can All right we should uh we should arm wrestle the answer out yeah well I think that's a very exciting ending to our panel because uh the fact that we will process the vast majorities of data in space is a huge change compared to what we have today so stay tuned there there's going to be uh a lot of uh cool stuff happening in AI in space and uh I hope that uh all of you will contribute to that so thank you very much we're at the end of the session thank you thank you",
