    "aggregated_text": "my name is James i'm the moderator for today as the MC has mentioned I'm from Artificial Intelligent International Institute uh it's a think private think tank that advocates sustainable AI for humanity i'm glad to be have these two guests before I get started first of all I want to do a quick quick survey how many of you do not know what is deep sea Okay that's good we covered the most important topic for today how many of you have not heard of deep mind Okay you all know while today's discussion about the deepseek moment a lot of thing happened to the AI revolution right But I want to say one more thing to you how many of you heard of thinking machine corporations Never heard of that right Thinking machine is 1983 in the US Boston that was the thinking machine moment that started the previous round of the AI revolutions that actually started the whole AI revolution okay I'm going to go through our moderation right now with lots of question from our two guests at the end of the session I want you to think about what will be the next moment after the deepseek moment can you forecast the future Right so we'll talk about that in a second so we're going to have uh EFA from N group i'd like you to have a introduction about yourself and the position or your personal profound effect on you seems the deep se moment in terms of the AI revolution in China sure thank you very much uh James and very honored uh to join this session and participate in this super AI event here in Singapore so my name is EFA i'm the head of solutions of the international business of end digital technologies so for those who are not so familiar with end digital technologies we are actually a subsidiary company of N group right So we're responsible for you know productize and commercialize a lot of our internal capabilities and make it available to our industry partners as well as clients right Most of the solutions we focused on are web3 technologies as well as AI technologies those are the underpinned uh capabilities of our solutions so the deepseek moment for me uh I would say there's a lot of changes in our companies in term of the AI evalu uh evolution right so we leverage on AI technologies to change to rewrite a lot of our you know softwares and a lot of our offerings to the market and at the same time we also build AI native offerings to roll out to the market and to me personally of course a lot of more things to learn right so it's a chance you know for everybody to grow together with this era so before I get to Ken so you think based on the deepseek moment as somebody who knows China well also the international market there is a profound effect in the shift is definitely yes because I think this gives a chance uh to change people's mindset from you know uh China is not just only a follower but also one of the leader now in the AI era and in term of the uh foundation technologies that empower a lot of enterprise solutions i see i just want to confirm what the end group was started by Mr jackm right Uh yes it is ah I'm curious did he call you when deep happened I hope so oh did he have an internal communication We need to do something right anything like that I'm just curious inside scope yeah not not not really at my pay grade but uh maybe you know there's some uh you know internal communication and has been you know initiated by the leadership team get your act together right We need to be making this happen i know Alibaba has the quen Quinn Q right Actually also very successful yeah that's one of the powerful LLM yeah good next I want to have Ken a chance to share about yourself and your position on this okay thanks James and thank you uh thanks for the superi and Ken from MMS so the MMS may be a new name for everyone so my uh our MS come from the MSI group so MSI group is also uh Japanese company group company so we focus on the Japanese uh insurance industry so for us for MMS we are based on in Shanghai China so we focus on how to using the AI to helping our business scenario so like uh like uh EFA say we also have the this year we has the deep sea we have a manus we have a lot of the new things to impact for the AI international so we say for us how to using the AI tools to combine with our business to helping the our normal user normal end user in our department to help them to doing the daily work cut down so also we have some the very interesting happen since I will be uh lead of AI and also I will be job rotation to some the user department we also know the pain point for our user so for the user side they also maybe some the rep repeatable for work in the daily so the pinpoint were very simple so maybe they saying AI okay can AI to help me to everything in our daily work to help me to doing this doing this okay I think we can so let's see later we also have a lot of use case we'll be sharing in the next moment i just want to share a little bit your parent company is the LA one of the largest Japanese insurance company right Yeah okay and they are investing in a startup in China to do using technology from China for as a as a insure tech right is my understanding yeah actually it's not for uh just for China MSI but also right now we are say okay because a lot of our have a lot of business scenario in the China since we have a lot of the uh good experience in our business case we see it can do something here to be refilled to the uh MSI group in the global since we have a 48 country have our company and also we have a lots of employee over 40,000 so I see okay we all inhouse we have a lot of the exper parents we can during a lot more it's very interesting for such a Japanese company which is normally conservative to tap into the China talent to develop a technology company and share it uh sell it to the rest of the world cuz I think there's another form that you may not be aware I think this is a real life example of something right now I'm going to move to the next segment of the questions now we have the basic right so given your insight I I want to get into real real insight something that nobody knows about I'm sure this why you're interested Okay as a Chinese kind of uh regional tag what is one paradigm shift within the corporation and end group is a big one right And your company as well what is the one thing that is a major shift that you have based on your observation that is a make a major move in your strategy Seems the deepseink moment okay yeah maybe I I take this first uh I mean first of all is n group is big but n digital technology is just a startup within this organization i see you are startup actually uh we we have a startup script and also you know we are empowering uh our client it's more like a 2B business which is a little bit different from our you know main parents to see business yeah so that's that's a just a small caveat so um I would say the big change that we notice and observe now uh in China since the deepseek moment is a lot of companies are starting doing AI transformation instead of just digital transformation which they have been doing for the past 10 10 years at least right so a lot of companies they they have you know for example in China many people knows about Alipe or maybe another another uh you know alternative platform and there are many many super apps right so those are actually the result of a digital transformation so people's daily life are rely on these platforms and you can enjoy pretty much a lot of services almost daily life services from this uh platform conveniently but now people are not just stopping there right so they found that you know why not to leverage on the evolution of AI to provide a more user centric and more hyperpersonalized experience so that's the key observation that we found since the deepseek moment you know instead of just exploring on AI capabilities which a lot of companies has been doing for past years right so they may use on SAS services right to access to to AI for example open AI services to try out some ideas but now it's more a real stuff a serial serious investment they were starting to invest on GPU servers on data centers to build their own model to build their own agent and eventually to infuse those capabilities into their offering or software applications so that they can provide a more better usercentric experience to the users so if I hear you correctly since the deepseink moment there's a lot of confident or strategic decision made to em embed the AI into all the user experience into the real product right in fact I heard that for the government as well in fact all the government department are all using deep dipstick right now so it's a very quick decision that everybody are deploying yes so many state-own uh companies and also the public service companies are starting invest on you know data for example Those data bureaus has been set up in the different provinces and city levels and those data will be eventually used to train the model and there's data collaboration platform and standard governance has been set up to facilitate this kind of collaboration between the public sector and the private sector okay and uh similarly and I think a lot of you know the the banking financial because and we are from the bank uh financial background so there's a lot of banks are starting to build their own AI native agentic bank apps so this is a significant move uh maybe in this uh region we found banks are starting to build their own super apps right so it's in the first stage of digital dilation but now some banks like Bank of Shanghai they have already roll out their first agentic bank mobile app right So customer users can use this app conveniently to talk to your agent and access your services so there is a shift where there's no more hesitant every department CIO here's the budget go do it that's what really happened in the last few months in China since January 20th now Ken for your company your context share us some insight okay so for the inside insight for the Japanese culture company so right now we say okay AI for the normal user when we using the AI it's just a chatbot everybody say okay we have a JPT for all we have open AI we have the in China we have a KI like do so so I just like test to test to answer the question but if we divide for the AI capability to something else for me I think the three main information for the AI will be the first one will be the understanding skill the second one will be the deeply skill i think deep uh deep thinking skill I think after the deep seek right now all the people know okay the AI also have a type called the reasonable and third thing will be the translation so based on the three norm common skills for the AI we can see if the skill combined with our business scenario we have a lot of interesting can be do for example for the understanding I just giving some the three scenario in our company for the PC right now so the third understanding since we are global company so we have a lot of the stand lot of the policy based on the home office level based on the regional level based on the BU level so the language of the menu will be the English Japanese and extra so but our global company for not all the people have a very good skills about English so the you we're using the first skills for understanding to understanding the menu we have and we establish a centralization the knowledge base and using the chatbot for the common use for everyone every country want to ask the question to with the chatbot so you can ask the uh you can ask the chatbot with the Chinese and answer will be also the Chinese but knowledge for the reference information will also come from the English one as follow one scenario for the understanding skill and the second one will be the deeply uh thinking skills uh you can imagine a newcomer just graduated from the university he has not know a very lot of information for our exist customer since we are Japanese country culture customer we have a very high loyalty with our customer like enterprise since we maybe have a 20 or even the 30 years relationship with our Japanese customer a newcomer when they come to the office come to the company they don't know they know nothing about our existing customer so why would now can using the AI with AI agent to let them quickly to understanding the customer's current information internal information external information since we have a lot of partner in the market to provide for the data for example we have just trying for one thing so uh we're using the AI agent to combine the one customer companies enterprise for the business information and news information for the external and internal we just using the API interface to get the insurance policy information and the claim information let's see what we can do for the this scenario we combine all the information and summary with a simple report and ask AI to do things to recommend what product for the insurance product can we recommend to this company so the AI will answer your question at that time when we do the POS PC we don't have the syncing resol but right now this year we change to the D seek we finding a lot of business chance we have didn't find it before so it's also the very useful for our newcomer for the marketing department to finding some of the business chance for the uh customer and the last one will be very simple for the translation for the translation maybe the normal thing will be to translate a A document to the B document so let's imag if we translate extend to more thing if we have AI lesson we have a lesson from the one language like it we maybe have a separate security training to the all the global we just using we just preparing for the English version at first we're using the AI to translate to the different language with a different video and different version we can let them very quickly to transfer to every country in the world and let them quickly to understanding what you want to talking to them and we can also using some the AI skills to summarize of the video information and gave the question for the everyone to teaching them and to questions them it's very simple so if my takeaway is that sounds to me seems that deepseek moment uh conservative organization like insurance or financial services are really adopting it really quickly when in China I noticed that when they decided to do it they were really doing very quickly now one thing I want to find out from you is I understand that you're using deep open weight model right Yes does it the cost open weight and the cost different makes a difference in your decision That's a good question actually for deep sea in China right now we also to consider for the localization since we are finance company economic company we have a lots of the logic and lots of standard and the policy need to above from the government so we trying to find a balance between the cost and ROI so let's see uh as I mentioned the AI tools were helping the everyone every employee in the daily work how to find out the let our management to believe that AI can trust AI answer can be trust so for example a very simple uh scenario so normal user they want they maybe think okay the AI answer is generate we can but I think maybe we cannot trust for the AI answer so let's see we have do for the AI for the chatbot save so first one one we also using some of the tools to make AI reference more simple and more easy to understanding we let the AI for the reference to let user to localization the original document original page original so when the user see the AI answer at first okay we can click for the answer we can directly say what's the answer comes from the original one so the AI user so the user when they using the AI chatbot they trust the AI also can be trustful and second way we say we also have a feedback function so as we know as you know we uh we have a lot of expert for the insurance we also have a long years for the experience for their underwriting experience so why not we can uh collect all the experience for our knowledge base and new knowledge base for our company own so we say okay we have our feedback function if the user our experts say okay the air answer is so generic maybe the true answer will be like something else they can ask happily manually into the knowledge base and the system will also save the question and answer as a new knowledge for AI for training and answer next time so next time if the similar question happen the AI will combine not only for the menu not only for the cap itself and also will combine some of the experience for our own company to as a new application for our own company sure i just want to get so does the opensource cost lower cost model makes a different important yes because I want the audience to take away this is one of the critical decision factor right now I'm going to manage time i'm going to have a series of question i also hopefully to find some time for you all to ask at least one to two question i'm sure you guys have some question to ask right now now we have covered from the inside China perspective i want to get your short and sharp answer right on where you think since the deepseick moment what is the number one impact on the global landscape I'm talking about outside China okay what do you think Uh EFA yeah i think first of all it's about the democraticization okay about the AI right so it's not just about the western technologies there's a alternative now uh and not about the closed source but also the open-source alternative so this really give a chance to everyone to every organization to think about their own AI strategy and plan accordingly okay and they can find a way to reduce the footprint and to eventually make it a better ROI for their business so it's really better for the global majority that's what you think okay right what do you think Any specific insight from your perspective I think the specific insight for the AI will be uh we can finding the AI have a more chance in our daily work so not only for like walking but also like in our daily life like you say if I want to finding some the uh even like evolution for the food right now I also to using the kimi to give me to create some words for the food it will be very useful for me since it will be giving a new some something more okay so for the daily work for of of course we also have AI for the lots of thing can do like translation like things I think more important things will be how to combine the AI with our real daily work so since we have a lot of the uh big story with AI we say okay the AI can helping in our daily works so the question will be how to do that so we can say based we need to based on the AI capability and also based on our real use case and real use painoint to combine all the information to see what's the best risk solution for the user to use in their daily work okay so you again a very specific question what do you think is the greatest number one impact on the global landscape I think the global one will be uh the AI will be changing everyone's daily world okay okay you'll be changing everybody's daily yes okay well I have an opinion in the sense that uh used to be before the deepseek moment only the people with a lot of money can do AI suddenly startup has more hope because you can do it in a different way because you don't need to be so have more efficient way of doing it this is my opinion okay now that is the global landscape now we are in Singapore right in Southeast Asia any uh what do you think are the greatest challenge and opportunity for this part of the world to tap into the deepseek uh technology etc yeah so I think I in that case I want to echo what just now Ken mentioned about language okay aan is a region with a lot of countries and most of the countries here has their own local language and some even have local slants so it makes a very difficult uh you know situation for a lot of organization to provide AI capabilities to their users to suit this kind of language capability previously sure and now some AI model large language model for example like the Alibaba Quinn model it can start supporting more than 100 of different languages so this partially solved the problem and can give countries uh in in this region to a breakthrough uh points to enable them to support their local language okay but on the other hand we are still lacking of the local based data sources so there's a lot of raw data written in their own languages we need way to improve those you know uh data sources to be able to infuse and use to train their localized um model yeah so I think that will be a big challenge and uh we are doing a lot of things to help uh you know local countries here to use specialized verticalbased you know uh knowledge base for example to help them in the rack process to infuse those local materials and industry specific materials in their model well okay good i just for the audience who doesn't know in Singapore there's organization called AI Singapore they actually did an opensource project on the something called the sea lion that support the different languages in Southeast Asia right So you think this something could help I'm sure they are using deepse as well as other opensource openweight model i think bite dance also have something like that as well so Ken what do you think uh how can this part of the world benefit from some of these opportunities as well as what are the challenges Yes and I know that you guys are trying to do something as well yes yes actually yes so right now for Southeast Asia like Singapore I think it's very good place to establish like AI center here so since we are like uh if they say okay we have a lot of the language here we have a lot of the company here and we have a lot of customer here right now we're using the AI to combine our daily work and to see okay it will be very useful for our daily like translation we have a lots of language people cannot using the language before like last generation like MP just can based on the native language to doing something but right now we we have a generation AI so we can translate using the gener AI to translate all the language to other one language right now we're using this useful tools to in everyone in their daily work something like that If we have a tools like translation we can also to combine with some the understanding skills in their daily work they can using the AI tools to compare for the file A and the file B very easily so for example very simple use case in our daily work so we maybe have some the document need to compare from the old one and the new one okay so last version we may be using the ARP to doing this comparation like to combine what's the difference between A and B but the question will be sometimes the information inside will be the same but the template will be totally different so so right now we're using this AI to understanding the whole document and to compare the another one to give us export some the report for what's the difference between the A and B also the one use case for use for for daily work for everyone because everyone has a similar pinpoint in their daily work right now we using the AI not for very big one just for small one startup we just say that and for the generation and also we have a lot of the company in the uh outsource as I as I mentioned We have a lot of company in South Asia we can also to help some in Japanese we also have a world like Tenkai tenkai is also the news as a Japanese world like we also have a good relationship with each other we can share the experience we can share the knowledge with each other why not we using the AI tenai to doing the same thing for each other EPU each other people to help them in their daily work i see more more you encourage this to be deployed across the world okay so there will be a good message to be uh delivered to the uh company here right now I want to get to the last set of question before I get into the Q&A for the audience before we come back again uh I think this top topic may have a lot of question so I want to talk about now we have been talking about your experience the last few months right I'd like you to share some foresight right now not insight where do you think is going to happen next year What do you think is going to happen What is the next moment based on your understanding of insight right now How things how fast things are moving Yeah um in previously maybe one year ago uh what happening in China is they are there there there's a Chinese term called botan in English stands for there are hundreds of morals and they are fighting each other you know so that that was a moment but what I think for future is there will be more and more enterprise applications really be infused by AI and eventually benefit the end users so it's not stopped just on the model model is the foundation layer right on top of the model layer we will have the agent layer and on top of the agent there will be the applications okay so only the applications can give the real value to the business and also the users so you expect lots of application training everyone and exporting overseas as well yes yes not only in China but built locally also the native AI applications built locally for local companies local users so that is the the the game plan you guys have basically yes okay so get ready when China decided to do this one thing I noticed they move really quick on that Ken what do you think the future is going to be what is the next moment yeah I think next moment I also have a two idea one idea is also agree with the FA so for the company side we may establish uh AI platform at first so we can base on the AI platform to establish our application by our own company we maybe some the plug-in for everyone can be using and also some the item application for the some unique person to using for like management maybe some the interesting for the smart BI with a with AI sometimes they just to type in question the AI can giving them the question based on the BI report and some power of the user will also say okay for underwriting can you maybe we can create a underwriting tools for everyone can be using in the underwriting department they can quickly to collect information from the different data source and combine a summary the information for their own and for daily people for the normal user they also maybe some of the plug-in and small tools for like I mentioned for the file comparation maybe some the data extraction or maybe some the translation tools for their daily work it will be useful for in the daily work also can be done for the this part for the AI platform that's one thing and another thing for the next part I think will be uh like more and more popular like AI rules are like uh double trains the digital trains will be the will be useful in the data world for example let's imagine the office we can also also to tell them okay you can monitor a situation like you going to the customer site to selling the insurance we have a AI tools to helping to know what's the user need for the business for the customer needs in their daily work and also the AI tools can combine all the information like the AI can also know the company information as mentioned so it can monitor the company information to ask question to you and you can say okay based on the question it will be uh asked by AI you can see to sum the question by yourself also can be monitor like AI training and AI creator for the uh some AI for HR training that's one thing and second things will be some the quickly to searching by the HR department for for simple HR department so for example some the JD right now we are just writing by manually but sometimes the HR have not very uh uh very huge uh techn uh knowledge about the IT guys for example the how what's the kind of IT uh skills uh he or she should have so we can ask the AI to doing that and also we can using the AI to quickly to searching the uh respment from the different channel and give the score based on the JD and give uh based on the replacement and giving the some the very quickly answer to the Android IT department or IT department to giving the match score maybe top 10 top 20 and the score and the people in the different department can do based on their experience to quickly find okay based on the 10 people here we can quickly find which one will be match our JD so if I understand both of you quite similar you think the usage of application will be more more uh more widespread right basically in as your next step I I agree with that but I actually don't my feeling is a bit different right I felt that the deepseek moment shifted in the mindset within China about investing in original innovation like the the basic technology I I think that is the awakening of more scientists in the professor to start looking into fundamental technology rather than just looking at application this where I foresee another wave of changes out of the China uh AI revolution so there's something this is my personal point of view right I think to be ready for that there will be new things coming out not just application which China is always strong in terms of that right now I need some help from the thing because I like you all to have ask some questions uh because I purposely allocate some time because it will be more interactive uh anybody have a questions can somebody help to bring the microphone please uh quickly uh uh introduce yourself what you do and then quickly ask your questions anybody Anybody You raise your hand sorry I can't see uh hello i'm Apurva i'm a student and my question is what do you think makes China unique in how it can be a competitor to the US and why not other countries I love that question because this event super is about East Midwest right now we're really at this good question now what is the difference in your opinion Yeah something quick and sharp it's a very good question i think first of all China very similar to US right Both are big countries even like India right So a lot of these countries you need to have your own technologies and you will need to provide alternative it's not just about one uh single choice dominant market so that's very important to provide a inclusive solution to the whole society and eventually we all mention AI for humanity right so it's the inclusivity that can create the creativity for everybody so that is where you feel that China is different in terms of that how about you can uh I think a China uh company as my mention will be some the very simple thing I interesting will be China's company like some a lot of the stock company in China we just focus one small things during the workflow of the AI and measure some part of the customer they say okay the AI will be so big we cannot to focus all the things in the AI we just say okay one part of the information I'm just focus on and good add-ons so example I have a friend for some company in China they just focus on how to using the deep machine to learning and to understanding the table in the document so maybe they were also to giving some of the tools for the market the market just using the to API interface to getting the interface to understand let the AI to understanding the table in the document so for us for like enterprise we just finding the resolution in the market we just say okay maybe your company is good at the table uh analysis we're just using your tools and use your API as one part of our holy uh uh whole resolution in our workflow we're just using the plugin our API you have to maybe the latest some new company coming uh and thank MCP we have a standard row right now and we can connect for everyone every plugin in the document in the workflow so we can change every document every plug plugin or tools in our workflow in the in our AI answer question to the answer so I think the may be the most important thing for China will be we sometimes we just focus one small thing but we think the some small thing will be very important to the all the workflow okay good i would just add a little bit in China this the internal competition are ruthless they really will kill each other over lower the price but they once they are do that they have trained then then when they go oversea they become very well trained to to be resilient to fight other war that's one characteristic I noticed that's a rat race yeah yeah there's a rat race that is that they to really kill each other but then whoever survive will become very strong then they are ready to do that I would say that is one one characteristic I noticed there's a her mentality to compete in the new space right I think that is a very good question But I personally felt that uh the e uh US a lot of thing for China to learn from and vice versa the other side i think this is where I felt that in Singapore we are a good ground cool playground for us to meet and have conversation and learn from each other hopefully not just not learn from each other in terms of making AI better progress better but also do something better for humanity right i think that is where Singapore play a role to have super AI as a conference here all right now I want to ask for any other second questions oh there's one more here uh okay go ahead whoever you can find yeah there's this gentleman here uh Jay right Yeah please introduce yourself and then ask the questions hi I'm Jayce i'm a startup founder from genuild.com so uh have China thought about the regulating uh you know genai content because you know there's good there's bad you know and it's now it's creating this thing called AI slop where you know people just creating a lot of geni content it's kind of like polluting our organic platforms so have China thought about a solution or thought about this topic good question i'm sure you guys have known how learned how to comply right Yeah tell us about that your experience actually that that's that's my answer for the last question for the key takeaways but I I I will do it now so um you know AI advanced so quickly right So we we really need to provide a responsive AI i mean that's the corporate responsibility to the society you may found a lot of fraud cases you know those fraudsters they use AI technology nowadays for example deepseek to try to hack the EKYC solutions and bypass certain this kind of safeguard and in order to hack into a people's account that's very common and it's almost happen every day because we are providing a EKYC solution called zolos and many local uh banks they are using this solution to provide a remote client on boarding and account access uh capability to their users so we saw a lot of deepseek based not deepse sorry uh deep fake based attacks happening nowadays uh almost every hour so that's why we are starting to use AI to battle with AI i see all right so we have using anti-deep fake capabilities such as the uh you know device injection capability and also to involve the device fingerprint in order to check through all these factors and feed it into a risk engine from there we will be able to see the fraud score and eventually to prevent China have a very strict any quick answer for that given the time okay just a quick answer very quick so I would say for traditional Japanese company we maybe have a Japanese culture here maybe we need to do something very carefully so like AI is the same so maybe for us for for AI internal we just say okay the AI right now is maybe some just start up so the lots of the things maybe like if I say lots of stuff will be just stop and will be updated by day by day so the compliance issue will also happen so for us we say okay the first step we just let our internal user to using internal first internal first so for maybe first for the customer side maybe in the next future so maybe if the AI answer can 100% nearly 100% but China has law on this right you have to follow right in the US there's no regulation at the moment right yes okay so for us for say okay we maybe we cannot confirm for the AI answer right now we just say okay it will be just a assistant for the user for the employee but it cannot be during the decision okay good running out of time I just want to give you two last quote to leave with our audience what would be the things you want to share with them as part of this conversation Uh EFA yeah I have my uh answer already use AI in a right way okay responsively use AI in the right way how about yourself Make AI accessible for everyone
