    "aggregated_text": "i'm Niels uh I have the great pleasure of moderating this panel with Unitry and Persona AI two humanoid robotics companies uh that have taken uh different approaches to humanoids making different bets about what will make humanoids great and have both made a big impression on the scene already we'll be chatting together for about half an hour today uh I'll try to uh cover all the questions that I anticipate you guys having and to kick us off I think the first thing that we want to know um Felix how soon do you think it will be before we see humanoid robots doing work real work uh actually and you know and humanoid robot if they will go to in the factory first thing and uh now in China some human robot is working and some factory car factory and do some easy job and to some people they will doing some job repetitive and dangerous and uh also dark job yeah they will let some this job state two and uh maybe three or five years a human robot will go into the uh home and service more people one thing I often hear uh in the Chinese robotics community is that uh robots have a big potential to help with elder care taking care of our parents when they're older uh how does unitry think about uh robots um in the care sector do you think that robots will mainly take dangerous jobs and humans will take care of humans or do you see robots also taking care of humans the first step I think the human robot will replace people doing some dangerous job and repetitive job the next stage maybe five years they will when with the development of AI and the human robot will get more function and will more powerful then this human robot will serve more people and to do some service job maybe in restaurant maybe in hospital maybe in Hare industry so we're seeing some humanoids put to work in factories already what do you think is the timeline to see something like a million robots gainfully employed when will we see a million robots working uh it's hard to say you know and now the technology is not uh very advanced and we need to step by step maybe five years i'm not sure but we are look for looking forward to this future nicholas you have a slightly different view about where robots will do work first um not necessarily uh the factories where we see a lot of robotic arms things like this uh you've already signed a couple of uh of early uh customers where do you think humans will go first what humanoids will go first what kind of labor do you think humanoids are particularly well suited for yeah thanks thanks Neils and Felix pleasure to be with you uh it seems like I can't open up YouTube anymore and not see the coolest videos uh that Universe is producing so thanks for that and and it's it's awesome to be here yeah as you mentioned we have a slightly different view um it's really driven by where we think the strong economics are um and it's it's unclear uh how the economics are going to be situated for the home or other markets where the labor costs are not as strong so at Persona we decided to focus on the the industry side and the industrials where uh the skilled trades are in extreme demand and this isn't so much a cost-saving measure as it is it's uncovering backlog in a lot of these corporations so we wanted to be obsessively commercial so we took a we took a view of the market and said okay where is their massive labor turnover where is there uh significant shortage and what expresses the humanoid form the best when it comes to dexterity and dynamic locomotion and so we decided that the heavy industry was likely to be a first mover market here the anti the antithesis of that in my humble opinion is the home um where I think the economics are unclear the work is hyper unstructured I'm not sure the consumer is ready for the third most expensive item in their portfolio the the house the car the humanoid it doesn't pass the smell test that those use cases are are insanely complicated too so we wanted to stick with the more semistructured where it's complicated but it's achievable and so we think welding as we've been very vocal about recently in in in news we' signed a deal we signed an agreement with with HD Hyundai for ship building and uh if you look at longer term the industrials market have a labor participation rate decline which is expected to be about 50% over the next 20 or so years so getting back to your question on you know when are we going to have a million humanoids deployed some of the marketing research out there says maybe as soon as 2030 with 10 million deployed by 2035 now I think those are pretty bullish upside cases but it it it's the general sentiment because you have this confluence of of social aspects technology tipping point and the economies uh the the the economic side kicking in for the first time I've been in the humanoid development world for the last 25 years i've got my career started at NASA became an entrepreneur about 12 years ago started a few companies in robotics uh specifically around humanoids that go underwater uh and and the like and for the first time what I'm witnessing is is industrial companies raising their hand saying \"We can use this type of intelligent technology to help supplement our our production.\" You contrast that to 15 years ago you couldn't get a car company to put a logo on a on a video with a humanoid robot in there it was it was taboo so I'm really excited to see the social component to be coming around um but uh from from Persona's aspect we think the heavy industry is probably going to be one of the first mover markets that have the strongest use cases the strongest economics and the highest demand where do you both think the potential bottlenecks are today so we're still quite early in the hardware development we're still quite early in the software development but there's also a cultural aspect of this right like how ready are we um to have humanoids working alongside us do we know what it means for insurance all of these things uh where do you think the biggest bottlenecks are to see humanoids get deployed at scale over the next few years is it hardware is it software or culture the software and the hardware and the manufacturer always is changing you know and you know and the for hardware and the power power density and the act actor precision and the season fusion yeah and how to scale up all changes and also some uh culture and um regulatory stuff with this robot want to uh how to make a decision uh how to do some handle some difficulty task how to uh see the in the different environment it's all depends on the software so I think the fix the bot neck now uh is software if we solve the software as the hardware will gradually developed how does unitry approach getting ready on the software side what do you what is a big area of R&D for you over the next two years what what piece of software do you think will help robots the most in the in the near term uh for now uh we just uh do some software to let this uh to let this robot can do better like can do some dynamic uh actions like a boxing uh like some dancing like a Chinese curve yeah uh this uh this basic uh function we want to let this hardware most strong and we also want to find the potential of the human robot and uh in the future we will excite this robot gradually and we we will step by step and to find more potential of the robot but now I come to say um I just don't want to wet the future of the robot where do you see the big bottlenecks being Nick well from the performance side I think we're getting very close uh the hardware which has been there for a little while um not not nothing earthshattering has changed in the hardware performant aspects in the last 5 to 10 years the software is moving at breakneck pace so much so that it we're we're struggling to intuitit how quickly we are are able to deploy so so there's a little bit of a gray area where I think the highest risk honestly on adoption of humanoids it's going to be on the customer side um you need to consider I think one should consider that when we put these when we put these machines into commercial capacities customers have zero tolerance for things that will increase their cycle time think about it in the context of producing a car automakers are shipping a car a minute something on that order they're going to have zero tolerance for humanoids if they do the task 16 seconds instead of 14 seconds these things are ballet and scripted so we at the same time need a customer base that understands the long game has the vision to to work through the messy middle of adoption because it's going to be messy um demos make really crappy businesses and and we have some excellent demonstrations of where we believe the state-of-the-art is but it is absolutely an open question and it's unclear how that translates into real economic value for the entire ecosystem of customers which are going to support and drive the adoption the adoption of this so I think the technology we can handle there's a lot of open questions training for for humanoids is an enormous problem it's an expensive problem it's very different than than how the traditional LLMs are done now you know the last 50 years was the ubiquitous manipulation of the virtual world we're we're conquering that right but the next 50 is going to be the ubiquitous manipulation of the physical world being able to move our environment around at will on demand it's going to take an entire new way of looking at how incorporating data training the models getting them distilled and deployed uh to produce action and and we're talking about multimmodal aspects um so ensuring that we have the right customers as our first partners that understand the long game nature of this in my view is one of will be a barrier and and if we get this part wrong it could set the field back many years so if we don't have humanoid robots working at scale 10 years from now where do you think we went wrong besides like a meteor hitting the earth um there's it's a 10,000 piece puzzle puzzle and hopefully we didn't drop a few of those pieces on the ground and you have a couple gaps in your big canvas where your Eiffel Tower you were building was um I think if we if we screw up uh if we overhype the market if we try to illustrate that we think things are a little too early if we don't bring on the right partners um it will discourage the financeers which are critical to to funding the cash burn that will be required before these companies turn into material revenue and dare I say profitability which I know is a weird word in the robotics community um but that's that's the game here right we're we're we're out to build successful businesses we're entrepreneurs um we're not research institutes the entire humanoid community has is coming out of research it's now stepping foot into commercialization it's a completely different game if you look at how the industrial robot is is doing it's it's been has been successful in very limited capacities pick and place painting welding uh in hyperstructured environments where you can't even put people near them we're now positing that we can put intelligent machines in the world around us working shoulder-to-shoulder as we supplement the labor uh scarcity that that that we're having so so this is a this is we're not going to be able to install humanoids in the same uh in the same psychology that we did industrial robots and so um it's going to take a completely different view on how to socialize that with a buy with the buying side let's not forget we need buyers we we we don't need to write papers so today um Asia is the largest market for robots um in South Korea every 10th worker in manufacturing is a robot today um last year more than half of all new industrial robots that were installed were installed in China and more than half of all industrial robots in existence are on Chinese soil today um the US is barely breaking top 10 in robot adoption which to me seems to imply that it's not just technical challenges there's a cultural element to this as well uh why do you think that the US has been more reticent to adopt uh robots at scale compared to um Korea Japan singapore is actually one of the uh most robot dense countries in the world u what's keeping US adoption down well I don't think there's any coincidence that I'm sitting here in Singapore and that uh our first opportunity is in Korea um Singapore ranks number one uh of robots per deployed uh per 100,000 people and and Korea is number two so uh as as far as the US is concerned uh that's a great question um and we I think we're up against different challenges regulatory environments are slightly different um the the manufacturing base and and how it how it intertwines to to the labor force is is different um I I have a lot of hope though because as far and I'll you know speaking from somebody who's from Houston Texas and and uh um Houston is one of the largest manufacturers uh in in the US it's I think it's the second it's got 6,000 individual manufacturers it's the energy capital of the world it's the largest medical center in the world it has NASA's largest space centers in Houston so it's a hyperindustrial city so we're on the front line of seeing how customers are feeling this will be adopted and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm absolutely uh but again back to my point on on commercial uptake there's no tolerance for it not working and on the heavy industry side we're going into industries that uh we have to be right and it has to work uh or they'll push it out the door and they'll keep doing what they're doing uh the the uh the the the the squeeze that's happening though is they can't even hire folks for these positions um if you look at some of the vacancies in the skilled trades they're enormous so the what my hope is there's no alternative so So we're up against the wall in the US and uh I wouldn't I wouldn't bet against it i wouldn't bet against the US it's just a problem to be solved i believe it's tractable uh but the thing that's driving it is there's honestly no other options felix uh why do you think that China has been so successful recently and what are some of the decisions that Unitry has made specifically that you think has put unitary in a a good competitive position a good question uh you know and China had a very strong supply chain so YNI is very lucky in China and uh you know we entered the human robot in 2023 uh and uh we enrich our product line and also gives the customer more choice you know and uh now product cover humanoid robot and crop robot and also robotic arms and some lighters and something Uh another strength of our our company is uh you know and we focus uh from the beginning to now we focus on the hardware and recently we also develop the uh software we want the software most strong to equipped with my robot and we have some factory uh and uh you know and the first robot uh we developed also equipped with the self-developed model and also the lithium uh battery pack also developed by our company and now we also produce the mechan arm and the depth camera and the lighter and something and we want to make better every Yeah do you see a a big market outside of Asia for for unitry do you believe that unitry will be successful in the US and in Europe uh or is Asia the main market for for robots over the next couple of years uh you know we now we have cooperate with many partners in different country uh including American including some uh Japan Korea and the European countries on Australia and also Singapore and many countries we want to build a network with certified uh agents we want our um partner to serve more customers i my next question is about how we will uh choose capabilities for our our robot i I see two schools of thought in the humanoid community one is that we will have general purpose robots that you can kind of ask to do pretty much anything uh there are some companies that are uh pushing that line pretty hard and other companies that believe we'll have more like an app store uh for your robot so you get a robot and you uh buy apps or even pay hourly for different kinds of apps you know like you buy the you buy the humanoid but for the humanoid to do your dishes that's going to be five bucks an hour uh how do you see this are we going to have a general purpose uh robot that kind of knows how to do everything or are we going to reinvent the app store again for robots uh will we have an AI that is a general intelligence can do anything or will we have an app store for robots where you have to buy specific capability for the robot what do you think uh you know and uh it's a little difficult if you want the robot to do many thing uh now the robot just can focus on one thing like some uh some specific jobs if you want the robot to do many jobs and like to grab something like to print something or like to put something it will covers many technology you need to uh let this robot to identify something and to make some decision yeah this uh a little difficult so uh we need the best uh step by step and um yeah what do you think Nick app store or AGI I think it's depends on the horizon you're concerned with temporally um clearly the holy grail is is is humanoidesque intelligent machines that have a general understanding and can create action just like I mentioned right the the ubiquitous manipulation of the physical world uh it it's just how we get there and right now the pressures because a lot of the community has become venture capital backed and not government grant funded that the the VC world has shorter time horizons and and a lot less tolerance for not achieving success than say a government grant would so now we've got the clock the clock is ticking on commercialization so what persona's view and what we've chosen to do is to compartmentalize uh compartmentalize the actions we're not we're not sure that the way to to get the robot adopted is to is to shoot for the moon and and have a robot be able to be installed in a place where it has a general understanding of everything it could encounter right now we're not we're not ill we're not we've been unable to illustrate too much uh transfer of action uh even so much so that one activity in just different lighting conditions in a slightly different in a slightly different context is are breaking these things so there are absolutely open challenges so what Persona has decided to do is say okay we believe that the short term is probably going to look like specialized systems now we're going to have a common base uh and we'll be able to outfit the exterior uh because you know these robots are being are going to be infused into teams we work in teams these are going to be shoulder-to-shoulder systems uh there's a lot of branding that goes into a team there's a lot of uh outfitting where you want your buddy next to you which happens to be a humanoid to look a little bit like you do when you're wearing coveralls so so we believe that it's going to be disperate and segmented into different personas which is what we've uh what what we're calling it and and our first persona we're putting out is welding um and then obviously there's a million subsets that that go that trickle down from that but we're trying to we're trying to narrow the problem down i feel like if we try to solve too grand of a vision that we're going to be diffused too much because at the end of the day it's it's I need this activity done um and there's a subset of activities that are closely related uh and and the the the promise is humanoids are not they're not um overfitit machines right they're not task optimal they're set optimal so if you have a set of activities under under a a uh a framework of let's say welding or assembling or or something of that nature uh I believe that that's going to be the winning strategy if we if we go off and and try to create the do all be all everything robot I think we're going to it's going to be a while and it's going to be tough but back uh to to finish up if I may with with the app store I do think you are touching on something exceptionally important though i think we make a mistake talking about humanoids as as robots too much uh we're building platforms and this is going to create an ecosystem and platforms are typically a four-sided ecosystem and that's that's that's what I think is going to drive so much of not only the TAM but the interest and all the other spinout companies i mean just look at you know people are probably tired of talking about the iPhone but but let's look at some numbers in 2007 there were five major uh phone providers right you had LG Samsung Sony Ericson Motorola and I can't remember the ne the fifth one they had 92% of the market share apple had zero the iPhone had 0% market share in 2007 it had 4% of the desktop OS market share apple was a struggling company in 2007 and in eight quick years those five companies went from 92% market share to flipped to Apple had 90% market share and only one of the companies that had uh one of those five companies was not losing money what did Apple do apple put out a platform they didn't put out a phone they put out a platform they knew they couldn't compete in the phone business in my opinion i'm not speaking for Apple obviously but they put out a platform so humanoids are absolutely going to be a platform they're going to generate an enormous ecosystem around them and so one day when they are in the home and you want to DJ for your party you might download the Spotify app and have your humanoid DJ a party right so so in my view this is where it's going to trend and one of the ways that this is going to uh speed up the adoption is when you get third-party groups start developing applications for the robots i think the business model is also open on how are we selling the platform is it a service you know what we're still working through these issues on how customers are going to take it once those become solidified then you'll have the whole environment generate the commercial elements around it and I think one of those is probably going to be a humanoid app store for sure uh A third path into the future of humanoids that some have espoused is that the main purpose of a humanoid is actually remote work teleoperation um that the promise of humanoids is that you can have cheaper labor uh because you you could hire someone in a cheaper market like the Philippines for example to do uh work here in Singapore embodying a humanoid uh robot how do you see about teleoperation and is tele operation a temporary stop gap for humanoids or do you think teleoperation is a big part of the future of humanoids uh I think operation is also the important part of uh uh if you want the human robot uh to replace people to do some difficult jobs uh maybe you're in Philippine or in Thailand maybe you want to some jobs in America or USA or Japan or something but uh I said before and uh uh we also wanted to train a model and uh if this model equipped with the robot and uh the robot can make the decision independently and don't need to tell operation this will easy for in the future what do you think Nick is telleration a stop gap or a permanent fixture well telly operations all we've had for a long time and the again the 25 years I've been in the humanoid business the lion share of it has been uh methods of teley operation we were discussing avatars uh then when we flew Robonaut 2 to the space station it was a teleyoperated platform but then as the time delay increased we had to embed more and more intelligence intelligence into the machine because there's a 3se secondond time delay from the ground to the space station so you couldn't do teley operation lots of studies We say that as you uh go toward about a 600 millisecond time delay in your teley operation that the that your task space narrows considerably because your fine control becomes complicated so then you start having to put um you have to start putting things in place that allow you to to to tell teleyoperate but now you're abstracted slightly away and now you're more supervising the system and now with with where we're heading in in today's modern landscape of AI it's all right well we can just remove the teley operation component and now we're we're talking about how we manage the system so I think uh there are probably there are probably activities where teley operation could make sense but not for a broad adoption of of a humanoid i think the correspondency uh could be a topic we could get into so general teley operations one to one right one human operator for one robot as the correspondency increases and you have one operator for five 10 100 500 right but now you're acting as a supervisor so you still have to have a a significant degree of intelligence embedded locally at the machine it has to be able to make decisions uh on its own it has to handle the real-time dynamics and so now teley operation is not even a word that you would use to describe that um we we've looked at teles surgery we've looked at things not not a persona but at but at NASA um and so so we we've the folks I used to work with have studied this pretty substantially and uh I do not believe in again my opinion is that teleoperation is a long-term viable solution for any mass adoption of a humanoid platform now teley operation is going to be useful in training but again that doesn't scale either so that's another open issue is is how you derive the learning required and how it gets transferred out to the platform right now we're demonstrating it right we're doing human behavior cloning or demonstration learning whatever the moniker is these days uh but that's not going to scale to a thousand robots i mean one thing you can say pretty safely is we don't have a humanoid company out today that has a thousand robots deployed in a factory somewhere where 500 of them are in a revenue generating capacity the field is still is still extremely nent there are some excellent demonstrations out there that uh show a lot of the possibilities uh but it it remains to be seen where each of these pinpointed technologies like teleyoperation are going to assist in how these machines get adopted one of the things that scares me personally a lot about this near future with um robots is something that uh Elon uh Musk of Tesla said about a year ago he went on Lex Freedman's podcast and he was asked what will it take to win the AI race and he said you need two things you need the best compute which is why he's building his big data center in Houston and also you need access to the best data and he said on this podcast that you know we've already scraped all of the internet we consumed that that wasn't enough to make good robots but he said Optimus will be the greatest source of data in the world this is something that scares me personally a lot we've never had mobile sensor platforms like this before like Mark Zuckerberg knows everything I post online but he's never had the ability to go check what's in my wife's bedroom drawer um how how will we learn as a culture to trust these robots or will it just come down to consumer discretion like who we choose to trust to invite these robots into our home uh how does Unitry think about data collection from robots out in the wild um is is this something that Unitry wants to do like Tesla is doing or do you believe that uh the privacy of the user needs to be protected uh and uh you know and is different with Tesla and we al uh we now just focus on the hardware and uh you and also we developing some basic software uh we just want to focus on hardware yeah how about you Nick looks like we're running out of time uh so that's one of the reasons I think the home is going to be challenging but let's not kid ourselves we're putting devices everywhere right now that are collecting probably more data than we're comfortable with we just don't know it so let's let's be a little open to where we draw the line on okay well now this is where this is what we're not going to accept um that said I think you're going to have an easier time with data in an industrial context which is going to help drive again I sound like a broken record but obsessively commercial adoption that's all I'm concerned about is how do I put robots in the field and how do I make money with them so being able to bound the problem where I'm working directly with a corporation to understand data management and how we're going to use that data to train the robots and custody and all that stuff that's how we're choosing to solve it as it scales broadly as robots get out and among us and let's not forget we already have that so how much data do you think self-driving cars are collecting or just cars in general with cameras all over them they're collecting again more data than you're probably comfortable with so now it's not in your wife's drawer as you as you've alluded to um that is a separate challenge but it's it's it's one that's a ways off uh but it's one that has to be confronted we are running out of time to wrap this up a little bit one thing that really resonated with me on this panel is the idea that we don't necessarily have to think about humanoids taking our jobs there are so many vacancies so many things that we as a civilization want to get done that isn't getting done today uh the future of humanoids is very exciting there's a lot of work left to do both on the the hardware and the software and the culture of these get adopted please follow the work of Unitry and Persona and uh please join me in thanking them for their time",
