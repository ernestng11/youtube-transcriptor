    "aggregated_text": "i'm Savannah Kenowski i'm a managing director at IDO where I run our emerging technology lab we're a global design and innovation firm helping businesses adopt emerging technologies um for all of you let's start with some context how would each of you describe your company and what you're building and also what makes your take on AI agents unique sorry Shandra uh so I'm Chandra uh I lead AI for kitim we started Ola Kutim to build the sovereign AI that is when I main sovereign AI it's building the silicon which is the core infrastructure cloud where that's where every processing happens and then models and applications we are building that for India the full vertical stack because that's billion users uh hundreds of millions of smartphone users so that's what we are building right now in terms of agents how I perceive or how my team or our team is looking at is we're trying to focus more on consumers because I think at that scale we think the agents can have an immense impact when hundreds of millions of users and uh consumer is one of the areas which is yet to be picked especially for multilingual markets you know when there are unique requirements than more uh narrow niche and that's what we're trying to address with the agents that we're building awesome work thanks Savannah so on the theme of AI agents we're building AI agents an AI agent platform for e-commerce brands um but essentially what we're doing is that we have a platform where e-commerce brands um can manage their product information all in one place and have AI automate and run their most tedious and mundane parts of their workflows so if we imagine a brand like um Adidas or Bibong let's say the type of products that they get they can get hundreds or thousands of products and new products in every single month typically you have an entire department dedicated to doing things like creating their product descriptions cleaning up their data sourcing for information getting all their images ready within Hypotenuse we have a way in which our AI can run through all that information for you hold all that in one place and do all that cleaning categorizing creating of content um editing of images all that automatically for you so we can take that from a kind of workflow which used to take months to run to just being able to be done in a couple of days and for us we're very specialized in being able to handle this for large e-commerce enterprises we work with a lot of the largest Fortune 500 brands globally um empowering all their e-commerce data and product information in the back end very cool amazing um hi everybody my name is Eno i'm the co-founder and CTO at Factory and at Factory we are building a platform for enterprise organizations uh to delegate software development tasks to agents uh and so what that means concretely uh coding incident response uh technical writing uh all of these sorts of higher order software developer tasks um uh basically can be executed by agentic systems we call them droids in our platform and the uh you know a lot of folks are focused right now in the AI software space on coding like the idees and uh coding agents we think that's an absolutely critical part of the workflow uh but there's so much more that software developers do um and in particular we're focused on helping organizations navigate to agent-driven software development so basically transitioning from I'm interacting with an agent collaboratively like AI assistance towards I am divying up tasks planning them out and parallelizing them i'd say that probably the biggest uh maybe like difference in our take to how agents are built there's a lot of things that we think are important that LLMs alone can't solve like memory and uh you know proactive understanding but in particular in the enterprise controls for agents that have capabilities to execute code run CLI commands use identity are super important and so we've spent a lot of time thinking about audit logging like how do we make sure that we know who to blame i think there was a talk earlier about you know who's to blame when an agent does something wrong right um we build out a lot of controls to make sure your organization feels secure in doing so okay so all super interesting leading edge work all building across multiple parts of the stack i want to I want to get the obvious question out of the way up front take a look at the session title what's next for AI agents um I can start maybe so I think it's just the beginning of AI agents even we as a community are exploring what is capable what is the capability of these agents especially when they come together in a multi- aent systems what kind of task they can do what they are capable what are their limitations i think the next frontier of agents is about trying to find uh trying to make many many agents work together for example as Joshua mentioned there is this coding agent there's this memory in the context of let's say consumer agents we want to build assistants which can order food order groceries book a cab do some complex reasoning so I think the next frontier at least the one which is which will next one or two years will be dominating is making this multiple agents work together and making the specialized agents be more and more accurate so as they become more accurate the coordination also improves and and and when you bring them together with all the elements that are required I think we will see a lot more impact versus what we saw one example is when chat GPT came you know first time when we all use it was simply transactional it cannot do complex web reasoning and all of that but now what we seeing with maners and what our team also is building you see that these agents are now capable of doing much more complex task and that's what that's where things are moving they're becoming uh from level one I mean deep mind and open defined five levels of intelligence level one was simply conversations level two was uh you know agents which can systems which can do solve a complex task right now we're getting towards system level three which is agents which can do much more complex task and assistants which can work together with multiple agents i think that's where we are we will soon see innovators and then communication and the organization which is level five but we are far away right now in the the immediate term what we are seeing is agents which can work with many many independent uh agents or systems and then bring them together to deliver more complex tasks which was not possible before very cool sure to add on to that as well um I think we'll probably discuss this a little more as we go but I would actually I think Tendra you're mentioning that that's very far away i actually don't think that that's extremely far away i actually think that's there might be actually something closer than we think as well um but I think what's next for agents to me I I think of this in two parts one of them is on the model scale um area and the other is on kind of market adoption and and what that means for the application and industry layer as well so the on the model side definitely exactly what um uh Chanja you're mentioning as well we're going to probably see a lot more models where memory is going to be uh solved next I think we're going to figure out some way in which we have some level of continuity much longer running tasks where instead of just a model being able to go out and run for a couple of minutes and do a bit of tasks you can have ones where it's going to run for a couple of days instead we're probably going to be um solving some things around um context windows as well where um entire kind of days or entire pieces of research and industry level knowledge are all going to be encapsulated uh so that you can handle much larger scale things probably much better function calls um things that are already being worked on as well but I think that next level is actually turning all this into something that's extremely accurate extremely reliable multimodality as well so that we can have models which continuously running alongside us and performing all the actions that we need to see in here but I think also what's exciting for um agents in general is also what that market adoption side looks like we're really crossing thresholds where in the past we there were lots of things that we couldn't rely on agents with LMS are not something that's extremely new in in 2023 we already had AutoGPT and a lot of attempts with GPD4 to create uh multi- aents and environments that could run all of these but what was missing was that reliability these agents kept hanging these agents kept getting stuck in different types of loops this year we're starting to cross into that threshold where these models are getting strong enough to actually run in multi- aent scenarios being able to tackle much longer running tasks and I think then what's interesting or what's next for agents is really real world adoption over here for us we can see entire enterprises where these are Fortune 500 companies that are taking on these agents and it's not just in small kind of minute tasks but it's ones where they're giving full decision to it not just here's a small task and I'm going to check everything but here's a longunning job uh for us it's going to be taking care of all their product information and taking on that full decision-m process for it and sometimes not even checking everything that's done by the AI i guess a follow-up question for you is what are the big or either of you um what are the big shifts in technology or breakthroughs that you're kind of coming see coming through the pipe that are enabling these types of changes and kind of bringing the future forward faster than some of us might expect i I think uh memory is something which uh will be big and I think probably Joshua would like to add to that we were discussing this backstage as well uh I think that's one area where a lot of work is going to happen because right now we have as I was saying there are individual agents they are good at one task but the moment you bring in multiple elements together then you know you need to remember you want to minimize the time a task can take 10 minutes you want to reduce it to 1 minute and then to do that you need to know in advance and why don't you add to it yeah absolutely I think that uh you know we've touched on two things that I think are like tech blockers memory or statefulness in general right so You could have interactions that you've already had that can be stored we call that memory you can also have um a like more proactive information that the agents absorbing around the environment storing that for later use and I think that just consistency in the interaction pattern is something that probably needs to happen at the application layer rather than that the model provider layer um versus the long-term goal- directed behavior that you mentioned uh that ability to persist over not just 10 minutes but an hour or five hours comes from blending statefulness with post-training which is ultimately going to have to happen at the model provider layer um and I think that anthropic openi a bunch of the labs are all very focused on improving the time spans by which these can operate but until we have that I think it'll probably be difficult to to orchestrate your way out of that um but I think that the third thing that is pretty interesting uh on this idea of adoption is really the behavioral shift that's required to interact with agents versus assistance and I think that this is almost a UX problem where we haven't really built out um systems that can interact for hours we have Slack and Jira and these tools that we use with other human beings in the loop but agents are not humans they are a pretty different thing um they're maybe more like faceless contractors um and so the platforms that we use to interact with these systems is going to look really different um are going to look really different and I think that that is almost like a creativity problem on on folks like us to build out these interfaces um I definitely hear you on that side and a lot of the work that I'm doing is thinking about the human side of this and I think that we have practices where we're designing software and designing experiences for humans and we need to have software and experiences where we're designing for agents and the intersections between those two things um as well I'm curious to to dig into the human questions a little bit more um how are you already seeing agents change the way that individuals and teams work whether that's like the teams that you run or the organizations that you work with so so what I'm seeing is as we are building uh products which is consumercentric and also my team which is more developers what I'm seeing is that the adoption of the developers in my team they are using more and more coding agents a lot more like what the amount of code they could uh deliver or you know execute or whatever has gone dramatically has become 5x in the past one year and and test cases you know robustness that's all increasing but that's more audience which is more used to using these LLMs and intelligence but then there's audience which is consumers they don't know much about these they just want a good experience and what I'm saying is if you look at the smartphone revolution smartphone brings different apps I have an app for shopping I have an app for cab booking I have an app for search whatever right now what's happening again is that the entire UX is changing and what I'm seeing is as we build this consumer app consumer AI assistance what I'm seeing is that consumers are liking the experience where there's There's only one interface i just want to use an AI i interact with voice and I just ask it to do whatever cabs food whatever right and it does it it fails as well we're not there and that's why we need to go deep and build domain basically add more intelligence to it but also horizontally when they communicate we have to build that layer and I think that's very new and consumers are giving a lot of positive response as they're seeing this experience it will take some time but I think it's it's something which we are seeing early adoption and people who are using it we are seeing them repeat as well and I think if this becomes uh more uh if the adoption increases we will see the entire UX will change instead of companies building apps they will basically bring their MCPs and agent to agent we will cover that later in the maybe this conversation they will rather embed their uh systems their data their APIs in the AI AI systems I think that's what we are seeing early signs but I think we we'll need to know how good that can be definitely so similar there as well i think um as Shanch was mentioning on on the first part even our teams right now a lot of them are using coding agents they're using a lot of things that accelerate their workflows um so they can code in a way two three times faster um at times as well certain um entire components now can be built out especially I think uh with with Eno's factory as well um what we're seeing with our customers is that there's definitely a scope change happening in roles it's it's not just here's the exact role that you have before and now we're just going to lay on a little bit of AI or sprinkle it on and everything remains as before there's a bit of process change that's happening certain roles will shift completely where instead of um having any sort of um let's say for example some parts around writing or checking for or even kind of copying and pasting and and adding in data over there a lot of those roles are just completely changing and it's becoming now it's much more a reviewer role and an editor type role rather than um needing to kind of do that full process and so there's a lot of scope change to even just kind of bring people up where it's higher level seniority people instead of a lot of these um what people may may call kind of intern or or just fresh entry double type roles there yeah I think that we've similarly seen a uh a blending of roles so your org may have a software reliability engineer a backend a front-end engineer a platform engineer and I think that what a lot of agent-driven software development enables is all of this to be the same person now that doesn't mean that it goes from four people to one it's still four people they're just now touching the entire life cycle because they understand how to operate within it and I think that the workflow change that's interesting is a lot of the the comments here and what we hear as well from the enterprise is the volume of code that we write has gone up we're writing three times more code we're we're building way more but the actual productivity gains on like launch release dates and on hitting uh timelines and on regressions aren't changing so dramatically it's like 10% 20% and so people are like where's the 10x come from the orgs that we've seen unlock truly like 5 8 10x improvements are really changing the whole workflow from being a serial workflow where you know the whole life cycle might be I plan out what to do then I write that code then I review that code and I test it and then I ship it to I plan out five things at once and I spend most of my time figuring out what actually needs to be built and then I send the agents off to go and and ship and I think that there's almost like a a tick-tockification of software development that's happening right now where you you you kind of like shoot the agent off and you say \"Okay let's just see what happens.\" And it you context switch immediately to the next thing shoot it off see what happens and so I think that that is maybe unclear how productive that is like it's definitely exciting it kind of gives you that feeling of oh you know I might have my work completed for me um or I may have total slop that comes out of it it's hard to tell in advance but I think that we'll figure out better ways to review this larger volume of code with agents as well and so that workflow is just going to move similar to like GPUs versus CPUs from being a very serial thing to a parallelizable process definitely I think that we should coin tick tockification um here right now a follow-up question for you i wanted to I think that anytime we start talking about how our work is changing and um and how human labor is changing it's important to talk about some of the ethical questions behind this and the augmentation versus automation so how are you seeing that in reality start to kind of play out and what are your thoughts on how that's going to play out moving forward yeah for sure i think that this is something that we talk about a lot because if you look in the software AI agent space there's like uh at least a couple of companies that it seems like their whole pitch is you know come check us out and replace your software developers and I think that the reality is is that's something that sells well to VCs it's something that you can use to raise the next round of capital but when you actually deploy with an org what becomes much more clear is that technical competence is more valuable than ever uh the ability of a human being to plan and orchestrate is well beyond that of what current agents uh are capable of doing um and and it it almost seems like there is a clear role of human beings taking on a combination of uh ownership and responsibility for changes right someone does have to be their a human being at the end of the day to take ownership over the good and the bad um and the planning and orchestration process uh it being the interface to the human world is always going to be important and so despite uh the the I think broader like fundraising narrative in the space most organizations I think are taking these productivity gains and if you imagine that there's a some sort of ceiling of like software dev to be done right you kind of have to imagine that we're basically at peak software like no more software needs to be built we're at the max so at this point let's just stop getting developers and that's obviously ludicrous like we haven't gone to space we haven't fixed most of the biomedical problems that we can fix we don't have humanoid robotics and other sorts of systems like that there's infinite technology to be built still and we are just touching the surface and so I always say this but like I think this is the least amount of software developers that we are at at human history i would expect 10 years from now there to be 10 to 50x more software devs uh the last thing I'll say is that's not to say that there won't be demographic changes in like the types of organizations that exist clearly consolidation into very large horizontal organizations like Atlassian AWS Microsoft will happen because they have the resources to go horizontal and an explosion of very small organizations that can now do the work of what used to be 10 or 20 I think will start happening so you'll basically have the option of do something interesting novel new and do it 10 times faster or work for an enormous company um and help them on their like much more ambitious or larger scale goals curious what you guys think well I think if we some similar thoughts there I think in terms of that acceleration as well um and and augmentation i think if we if if uh for those of us who are in the Bay Area we would probably have seen some ads or billboard signs going around that says stop hiring humans um hire AI sales reps instead or or a lot of kind of similar type marketing style themes like that i I don't think it's something that's binary i don't think it's going to be entire everything's going to be just pure augmentation or everything's just pure automation for a lot of the things that we do and I think in software engineering it will be true which is a lot of that is very augmentation driven but there are a big number of roles and jobs where there is going to be pure automation coming at play and I think a lot of that is going to be if anything it's going to be scope change even for us we we definitely position ourselves as acceleration not pure automation we don't come in to try and replace entire teams but it does definitely create a scope change for what the people are doing previously a lot of let's say in the in the marketing space there are lots of people that are focused on low-level let's say copyrightiting or trying to form up uh different parts of ads or small um kind of very minute types of editing of images a lot of that now that scope changes to not just they will still be around and for a lot of the teams that we work with is still the same number of people but the type of scope of work the type of role that they're doing has changed quite a bit to become now more of reviewers editors and making sure that those can be done in the right way and and working together with AI to do that but not uh but it's it's definitely a big change and those those roles that were there before are no longer uh just pure collaboration it's now kind of a lot of automation together of that as well nice okay so watch this space we'll see how things continue to play out i'm curious to get into a little bit more of the details um are we talking about the existing software stack is there an evolution um what parts of the legacy stack are we going to uh be continuing to to work alongside and what parts of it are really holding your customers back um when we talk about actualizing this work so one thing which I'm seeing on the uh on the on the software stack I think probably Joshua has a lot more experience there but I think one thing on the coding side that I'm seeing is is that uh enterprises are not transforming the speed at the speed with which LLMs or the agents are uh innovating or transforming and the reason is there's a this you know Chinese wall there's a there's a guardrail that is this data this is my data I don't want it to leak so a lot of these things are very new and enterprises are not able to adapt and or bypass this or same thing even when we are building these products or solutions we are not able to get there as fast because of this data layer of guardrails so I think that is a big and second thing is the GPUs you know is it an on-prem or should I use cloud a lot of these things are yet to be taught and you know more generalized across the enterprises and that's what is uh that's the that's the barrier that all of us have to sort of uh pass and make sure that agents the enterprises actually adopt to these technologies because no you don't you can the things which can be done by one software developer for example uh right now they're investing tens and hundreds now what can be done is if I if my developer can use AI let's say co-pilot or whatever if I can do uh what I do in one week I can if if I can do that in 1 hour uh that actually help enterprises now they can actually do many many more things and that's the uh uh barrier because of this data that's not happening and that transformation will take at least couple of years and um I think there are some big players in each domain or vertical finance it we are seeing that but I think the the large mid and small companies are yet to adapt and you know catch up with the innovation that we're coming with agree on the enterprise adoption side as well I think one of the big barriers is how quickly these enterprises can move and actually take on their software a lot of it because of just internal regulation and policy but I also think it's one of the most exciting times for software um for once in the past few decades we have a chance to change everything a lot of the customers that we deal with they work with very legacy systems to store their product information these systems haven't changed in decades and every day they complain about them they say that they're very big legacy systems very slow very bloated it's hard for them to do any kind of task on it but yet they haven't had a chance to change in the last 10 or 20 years because if someone just comes in and they say \"Hey I want to make your platform uh 10 to 20% better and I'm going to build a nicer interface for you.\" There's no reason for them to change because it's a huge lift to change any of their software but for once in that entire 10 20 years of looking at these systems we have a chance to not just make it 10 to 20% better we have a chance to make it 10 20 even 30 times better and it's because we're building in a way where all these tasks that they used to do on these platforms we can now do it in a way where AI is going to be working alongside them it's going to be automating a big part of all their workflows that they're doing on these processes for us it means they need um automating their images for them their their content their copy that's written their data cleanliness and and all that in a way where now they they have a chance and now they're actually having large enterprises willing to shift entire systems because they know that the ROI the gains the efficiency it's not just something where it's being talked about they can see it in reality they can see the the multiples that they're gaining from it as well and I think that's where it's going to cause a a big shift in terms of enterprises uh coming ahead definitely still slow in in how fast compared to how fast LMS are moving but compared to kind of the past cycles of platform changes I think this is a much faster acceleration yeah definitely i I think that Yeah it is interesting cuz even in the enterprise what we've seen is that the largest customers that we have and the biggest accounts that we talk to are actually like almost more aggressively adopting AI than some of the more mid-market startups remain the fastest definitely but there is I think a reluctance to uh tr to to to pick an option almost because there's so many options and this is especially clear in like the AI software dev space but I think in a lot of products like you mentioned AI SDRs like um there's literally so many options that I think a lot of folks in the mid-market have analysis paralysis where they're like oh you know next year there might be a better model should we pick this model or that model versus in the enterprise they're looking at a couple of different things like security is this the right deployment um you know does it all make sense within our environment and then once those boxes are checked they're aware that as long as you make a reasonably good decision the incremental gains are are are going to compound over the next couple of years and so I think that the blockers are the classic stuff that have always been software blockers vpc our our legacy system doesn't connect how do we get that fixed um but the the more interesting blockers are you know when you have a field that's moving so quickly when is the right time to kind of make that decision it's like a stopping problem you know if I stop now am I going to lose out on on the next big thing um and I think that enterprise got burned by cloud they got burned by mobile and this time they're very much trying to not get burned by AI i think I'll just add to it i think that's where this if you look at the evolution in 2000 when internet was there and then there is this smartphone there have been protocols like there was TCP IP uh and you know then rest API so these enterprises started exposing their data uh to these whatever application is being built through APIs now I think that's changing and we have to teach them so there's this something called model context protocol MCPS agent to agent protocols where we have to build or we are building this uh new protocols with which enterprises would be able to safely share their data or share their bring models to their use cases as well and I think that's where we have to uh sort of coach or teach the community to adopt and if that happens then I think we'll see seamless integration and adoption as well i guess asking a question um about you know those fears like are we hitting a wall in AI development like some people are saying or are we just getting started and what's your you know thinking even further out or maybe not maybe today what's your current take on AGI um and what would change if we actually reached it is it 2 years from now is it 100 years from now and most importantly is it really AGI if we don't have AGI tigers and lions or is that just AG human intelligence big questions i think the at least to address the first part the the idea of there being a wall um I think that there certainly was conversation around this because synthetic data in the post- training process was not validated like organizations were saying oh for a while it was like every single org said the way that we're going to win five years from now is by having the data like we have this data that you don't have and so we're going to in and the unfortunate thing I hope that you all were not one of those organizations is that you can effectively completely replicate almost any proprietary data set synthetically and it kind of does just work which is pretty crazy very good for people who build on top of agents um it does mean that you probably have to find a new moat if data is your previous moat but it the workflow though remains incredibly important and that's I think what a lot of orgs have still the ones who said the data is going to be the way to win you still have that workflow that is unique that winning workflow that lets you succeed over your competitors and so because the synthetic data that we can generate to make models better seems to clearly be working and we're able to build bigger models we're able to put more energy behind them i do think that there's like a very clear path for the next 3 to 5 years towards extremely capable agentic systems um at least if you're looking at the main foundation model providers but past that I do think that we'll probably fragment into a world where the single best models require such an enormous amount of compute the sort of like let's let this run for 10 days to figure out the you know a a viable protein that can be used to fix a genetic disease like that sort of like super intelligence that is going to be reserved to people who can spend the amount of money required to to run for a very long time and a lot of the focus 5 to 10 years out is actually going to be distilling that intelligence into smaller efficient models that can be used everywhere um so I think there'll be a little bit less focus on like the frontier and more on uh distribution okay you each have one minute assuage all of our fears about what the future holds i think uh as I was I mentioned that there are there's this five levels of intelligence that has been defined by deep mind open as well i think the future is from level three to level four and five level four is innovation which Joshua is referring to you know these AI systems will start innovating uh medicines complex you know problems about space or whatever right so that is going to happen and I think we are very close maybe in a few years we'll see more of that and then there is this large institution which is level five and that also points to your AGI question where AGI is where where are we think it's very hard to quantify where AGI is because it's it it if you think about coding we're only very close like it's getting as good as the best coders that you have now the the best architect or the best coder will also build a system complex system design system and that we will get in the next uh one or two or three years so I think there are domains where we are very deep but then there are domains which is general intelligence I think we are far away we'll get to level four and then level five which I just I I have an idea I want to start a company but I don't want to you know build a team and all I just want AI to do that stuff for me that level of company or organization level intelligence will take a few years and but I think we are seeing early signs of those as the companies which are building certain use cases this wipe coding is early sign of that but I think we are we are still as a community have to do a lot in that We probably don't have time to debate on a definition for AGI here and what that looks like um but I don't think we're anything close to a wall i think if anything we're accelerating even more and we're only at the beginning and one of those reasons why grounding into research AI research and models is because of the scaling laws for the past four or five years we've been riding on LM scaling laws which tells us that if we increase compute model size uh data the performance keeps increasing we haven't hit any wall on that yet that curve looks so smooth that it's it's almost unreal and late last year it was announced that a second scaling law was found in which if you increase test time compute your performance continues to increase granted for those of us who are looking at it it's logarithmic scaling but basically all that says is that we're nowhere close to a wall even from a research perspective model performance is going to keep increasing for way more to come um and that's going to unlock a lot for us in the in the coming time it's possible that all the research breakthroughs that are needed to hit AGI may already be behind us and now it's a lot about just kind of scaling some of these up um for AGI itself I do think that's on a short time span away i whatever the definition of AGI is I think that uh a simplistic kind of point of view of what the definition is we probably hit it around kind of that 1 to three year time span but it I don't think it's kind of probability doom and everything's going to be bad if anything I think it's going to open up breakthroughs for us in science in in medical research in kind of even exploration and just um discoveries that humanity can create and I think that's going to open up a much more interesting or exciting world going ahead all right thank you so much to all of you and thank you to our panelists",
