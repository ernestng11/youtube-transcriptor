    "aggregated_text": "hi a very good afternoon it's great to be here um I'm very excited to talk about something that's transforming the gaming world which is AI for the longest time when you talk about gaming people think it's a niche it's small you'll never be big you'll never make money playing games it's overweight guys like me dressed in black you know um but you know what today gaming is huge it is growing at an incredible pace today there are 3.32 billion gamers worldwide whether you're playing Candy Crush you're more hardcore playing League of Legends I think everyone's playing games and the global gaming market is projected to hit $424 billion by 2033 it's a sharp rise from the $350 billion today now mobile and cloud gaming um are breaking down barriers so making games more accessible than ever before meanwhile AI gaming is emerging as a major force with a projected KGA of 28.4% uh to reach 28 billion by 2033 now we think that that's a pretty conservative um estimate with everything that's being talked about right here at this conference as everything comes to reality people have more time on their hands to play games and content needs to be generated bigger faster than ever before now gaming has always been a space where innovation thrives where new technology is tested is pushed and perfected in fact AI G logic has been part of gaming since the 1950s starting with Nimrod and the game Nim we've come a long way since today AI isn't just about smarter enemies it's about intelligent systems that enhance every part of the gaming experience now we are entering a new era one where games don't just respond to you the games understand you where bugs are caught before the games ever reach the gamers where AI empowers both gamers and developers to create an experience more than ever before now this isn't science fiction this is happening right now so AI is transforming gaming across three major areas number one game play is becoming more intelligent personal and immersive while seeing smarter uh opponents and allies AIdriven um non-player characters which NPCs now learn adapt and respond in real time making enemies more strategic making companions more helpful like real teammates games are also becoming more personalized ai adjusts difficulty pacing storylines based on how you play creating a unique experience tailored to each player and it's no longer one sizefits all it's one size fits you and finally realism ai brings characters and worlds to life with ultra realistic behaviors from fluid movement to emotionally responsive interactions that make you know everything feel just more believable now world building is also evolving so with AIdriven procedural generation we can instantly create vast diverse environments quests and story story lines on the fly de developers or designers can spend less time on repetitive task more time on what matters which is actually creativity and innovation for players this means fresh dynamic experiences with every time they play no two worlds are the same and that just keeps engagement very high and replay-ability very strong now game development is also becoming smarter and faster you know in the past a game takes you know last year there was a great game called Wukong if you guys know about it wukong Black Myth it took 10 years and millions of dollars now today AI is streamlining game production it automates QA testing stimulates gameplay scenarios and analyzes player behavior enabling developers to fine-tune and you know for their mechanics and deliver more engaging experiences it's also driving efficiency by generating assets like textures animations voice lines ai reduces manual workload cuts production cost and dramatically shortens development timelines it also accelerates speed to to market with AI powering every step and every stage of development teams can iterate faster launch sooner and stay ahead in a very highly competitive industry like gaming now at Razer we've always believed gaming is where innovation meets imagination and today we're pushing the boundaries again with AI um we're spe we're spearheading innovation in AI gaming with tools like Gamecore AI and QA companion uh why don't I just show you what we have announced so far greetings my name is Ava your dedicated AI gamer co-pilot from real-time esports coaching to postmatch evaluations I learn from the best so you can play smarter in any game offering expert advice for the mobile likely enemy rotation to top we should intercept FPS you're solo on a sight tell your team to play for retake arpgs after two swipes punish then dodge the followup and more my knowledge is limitless by analyzing millions of simulations within seconds I will always have an answer to your toughest gaming challenges step into the future of gaming with me now what you just saw is Project AA we first introduced it in CES earlier this year at uh in the Vegas convention as our concept for an e AI esports coach and now it's a real AI voice assistant that watches you play and gives you real time guidance whether you are in a high stakes you know multiplayer uh match or battling a tough boss solo game coai offers expert advice personalized tips and postgame uh analysis it's a very powerful example of how fast AI is moving and how fast we're moving with it now you don't have to tab out and watch hours of tutorials anymore you don't have to go read you know pages and pages of uh tutorials to learn how to play a game aa or Gamecoai does it for you real time uh right now and right here in Singapore we're looking for Bold Mines to join us in this journey uh we're hiring 200 AI engineers for our new AI gaming hub and partnering with local AI companies

come build and innovate with us i'll leave this up here for a little while reach out to us with the QR code um again we have been building our tools internally we realize as well that you know we can't do it alone it's a big opportunity um we are working with other partners you probably also heard um last week or two weeks ago I was on the stage uh with the AWS where we're working with them to launch our tools as well so anybody who is you know again passionate who thinks they have the technology to help us scale up much faster we're very happy to have a chat and see how we can work
