    "aggregated_text": "this is super exciting i like the pump up music as we come in it's setting the stage for this great panel so I'm super excited to be talking about Asia Rising and the next generation of AI startups because I think we've got an amazing set of folks here who are really experienced have seen a lot in terms of the startups that have come out over the last few decades and at the beginning of building a really new venture so I want to start us off by asking you to tell us a little bit you've done some amazing things can you give us a little bit of an introduction of all the cool things that you've been up to what you're super passionate about now Thank you very much uh INSEAD graduate 2004 after that I started a TV network called Asian Food Channel and I sold it to Food Network and uh that was 2013 when the ecosystem in Southeast Asia was very small and then I decided why don't we just be a venture capitalist because clearly it's easier to be a venture capitalist and then 10 years later open space we run $800 million we've done Gojack we've done Love Bonito we've done Choke we've done Redmark basically if you live in Singapore you've used most of the services that we've been uh very lucky to invest uh firm is 30 people across six countries we only invest in Southeast Asia and we depend on folks like yourself to demystify uh Indo uh India and last but not least I cook pizzas in my office yeah yep right excited to be here uh quick one uh been a founder twice uh took another three companies as a founding member to exit uh decided somehow to be in VC but not accidental i think for me it was a choice uh the deliberate choice was and I tell this answer to everyone which is after being a founder you realize either you like working with people or you don't and when you don't you decide to become a venture capitalist uh we invest across two funds uh a venture fund which does seat to series B a preede fund which does very early formative checks uh we pride ourselves for having been the earliest investors in six $5 billion plus companies uh including the likes of Razer Pay in India which is the largest payments provider uh Ola which is the largest cab company uh Daily Hunt is the largest media company and we have been actively investing across uh the Indo US corridor and I would rather like to call it the Asia US corridor and yeah super excited about everything uh people are building in enterprise AI and your firm used to be called Matrix Ventures so if there's anything that's a huge brand yes so we we were set up in business by Tim and Paul who started Matrix uh we were earlier known as Matrix partners all three across China and we decided to rebrand so we known as so this is Bruce um co-founder and CEO of CPNC I'm the only person representing the starting startups here and these are our potential investors perfect so uh um so very very short quick introduction of myself so I'm also a a PhD candidate as under school of computing uh well I'm looking at my age shouldn't be a PhD student but you know AI has just started a new life for everybody yeah so I decide to take take a take back a role as a student to learn more about AI and see how AI can bring the next generation of AI startups I love that I think that's a great jumping off point for us in terms of thinking about how is AI creating new opportunities so where I want to kick off our conversation is that I think that you know over the last few decades where we see a lot of innovation come from in Asia is from constraints where we're leapfrogging technologies where you know for example super apps uh cashless mobile first where we're able to actually innovate out of the constraints that we're seeing so I'd love to kick off our conversation by talking about what are the constraints do you think that we have here that create opportunities for AI in Asia right now Ken I'd love to start with you you're the first investor into gojack you've been investing in number of companies in this region that's innovating out of constraints where do you see the opportunity I mean I'll start even further back from there was like nobody believed that you could start up a TV network from scratch right And we used a total of $23.5 million of capital over 10 years to make a TV network that was more popular in Malaysia than ESPN and one of the things I never told anybody was that we never had a single piece of broadcasting equipment for the entire 10 years wow i mean we kind of had to figure out this concept of like cloud-based broadcasting which is basically ship your tapes over there today everybody does that and I bring that example up simply because uh I think that uh restriction of resources clarifies and crystallizes and also organizationally we're just talking about it means that certain decisions are justified if you've got all the money in the world you wouldn't have done a truncated population of mixture of experts you wouldn't have done some low-level orchestration and that's deep seek when they first came out and then the beauty about it is they made that architectural uh choice because they needed to do that and now everybody's learning from them so I'm a big believer of uh not having too much capital having the capital at the right time cuz frankly it does cause uh probably perverse incentives and wrong decision making no so I I think broadly agree and constraints do help right where I come from in India we have seen this play out uh over multiple decades in the space tech ecosystem right uh our space mission was probably 120th the size of NASA uh and is today probably one in five globally who do what they do uh I think constraints do birth a lot of more innovation and we've seen this in the past i do slightly disagree with the AI bit on what it m what it means yeah cuz we've seen this now multiple times where somehow because of this post Zer era also is still the same story infinite capital which is there with counterparts for founders in the west it does skew things a bit right so if you think of let's say AI you could be innovating going deeper on architectures building new things but just when you're trying to do that against someone who has infinite capital who is not paying attention to because they don't need to uh in a market where hyper accelerated go to market is most critical right so you think that it's actually going to potentially work against us in terms of AI or where do you look for opportunities in that case see I think uh where you look for opportunities with AI and obviously founders can attest to it better is I would actually think of it in a flip way I would think of saying that earlier with technology you had to think of software being an enabler yeah Whereas today entrepreneurs and founders have the opportunity to go after anything right not and I keep hear all of us keep hearing this that hey it's replacing labor it's replacing this I would rather flip the argument completely and say it's a great wedge for founders to go after the large industries which always existed right nothing is stopping you from being a AI native AI first company because you can be the incumbent won't be able to be at that fast to not think only technology or selling software to actually say that hey what does it mean if I have to build a AI native insurer tomorrow right and those opportunities are then so regional those opportunities are so nuanced and they have such underpinnings in each region India Southeast Asia everywhere and they're not small opportunities right cuz selling software in these regions can be a small opportunity but going after those big meaty businesses big large profit pools is not a small opportunity so I think uh constraints plus the fact that AI gives you that lever and leverage to use that technology as a wedge to not be just a technology business to actually be old industry like whatever industry you want to go after you can do that i love that i think that's a perfect segue Bruce i mean you're actually targeting to help productivity for businesses in Southeast Asia can you tell us a little bit about your view here For sure so I first of all I want to anchor um a Akash's point about uh the difference of selling software and selling AI solutions i think one of the constraint which we face in Asia is there's not a very very strong foundation for SAS not like in Europe or or US where you know organizations start to use software um as group and um can perform really well to um you know utilize the functions of software very well the constraint about the you know um um the organization not using software very well actually give the a good opportunity good avenue for for AI because AI is going to use the software for you you just have to treat AI as your assistant so this is this is just like how you know from um Asia is not taking the credit route but deep frog to the cashness definitely I see the the same huge opportunity he lives in Asia not anywhere else because because of the the weak foundation of S services so that that's number one number two I I I I see you know another another um you know point um definitely to the entire Southeast Asia is the fragmentation is what fragmentation fragmentation fragmentation the market is is not um a holistic market like India like China like like u like US or even some other uh big regions because of the fragmentation because of cultural difference um multithnic multilingual AI actually play a very very good role to uh you know to mediate the problem of fragmentation because of the the you know uh versatile um you know linguistic talent and cultural understanding that solve a lot of problem by unifying fragmentation into a unified market yeah so let's pick up there in terms of thinking about you know what you've seen in patterns for how startups are building especially AI startups are building in Asia you know what we've seen typically for a long time is sort of mostly thinking about the copying model and then localizing for exactly some of these you know localized opportunities is this something that looks different as you see startups that are building in the space or do you think there's a new opportunity here in terms of leading in a different direction with all of the key particular and unique challenges that we see in each market So I click baited everyone hopefully by saying that 90% of all pure play AI startups in I certainly can't speak for India but Southeast Asia will be in Singapore and so I'll leave that thought first i think what we're seeing in Southeast Asia is really a two-phed approach i think we're seeing increasingly more pure play AI startups here but there will come a time when AI enabled or AI powered startups will happen i'll elaborate that um shortly and can I push you a little bit What do you mean by pure play versus AI powered So no names uh you know but 50% of the world's AI researchers are from China i'm absolutely convinced of that cuz chat GPT just told me that right but it is quite true and if you look at the geopolitics today historically a large number of very talented uh Chinese individuals will go to San Francisco and the US but we've got a orange head man in the White House and no idea who you're talking about i got a laugh at that and you know if you're a Chinese researcher look I wouldn't be surprised if you're a huge you know revolutionary um large language model you know just in in Hjo and the state government goes oh by the way going forward you're going to uh work according to our u mandate and you know some of my employees some of your employees will be monitored it's not necessarily the kind of private sector entrepreneurship that you may have signed up for as little as 10 years ago and we've got this geopolitics so I always joke that there's two people two pictures on my office Cining and Donald Trump i kiss them every day i really do they're very great it's really good we don't like China but we love Singapore so great and we have a business because of that see I'm getting people laugh we have a obligation to entertain don't we have an obligation to entertain Yeah okay we're moving the the the forum in the right direction and that's why it will start here now data point sorry just to elaborate there is a team and I can't tell you where i can't tell you who full-blown allstar Chinese team with high gold star memberships in Singapore building a abstraction layer for GPUs financed by Hong Xan not even me they didn't want to take my money right Bought papers in Chinese globally ranked on GitHub one of the best hiding out in Singapore tiny Llama came out of Singapore again we hosted a party of AI startup uh researchers SUTD MD large number of them came from China we think that you know that is the first phase that we'll see in Asia and boy are we paying attention to that trend at open space i'll elaborate the uh second point later cuz you know I'm monopolizing yeah you know I think a funny anecdote that comes to mind from that inspiring or copying thing is basically I remember when I was a founder this is early 2010s uh in India and which is a pretty maturing venture ecosystem investors used to have a team called web investing and mobile investing right that's how like that if you want to get a glimpse of how unimaginative the ecosystems and venture people can be that's how It is right now but if you think of it what does it mean the every technology leap when it happens the first imaginative inspirations actually happen in the west and you can't change that somehow I I strongly believe it doesn't change uh through multiple technology cycles we have seen that so Uber was the first interface imagination where someone said that hey you have to raise your hand to hail a cab don't do it card on file do it on mobile right the first imaginations happened there but Then when you have to turn that into a scaled up beast right that happens in China that happens in India right that's the reason why we have super apps US does not have a super app ecosystem right I think it's going to play out in a similar fashion even in in this case I like that wherein yes we'll have researchers in China in India everything will keep happening but the first big wave of reimagining interfaces reimagining the consumer experience will potentially get sparked over there right and it has right that's what openi did that's where it started that's the way it started right but then this gen 2 the gen 3 is where this region will start dominating again and doubling down on that data yeah Bruce yeah so uh um when we think about innovations um especially on the foundation side um like foundation models it a lot of people think that it comes from um the west side from us first especially in Silicon Valley um I think generally That's true um but the difference is um the cost how deepseek how queen how um you know do from um from bance can lower the cost with similar kind of capabilities and this is definitely the first choice for any developers who want to scale this is how you know uh the cost itself is a major in drive driving force of innovation um so that's that's how I how I think you know the original way of thinking of leading and innovation has the definition has already changed because cost is is a key driver um the second one is on application level uh I think the entire Asia is pretty strong in terms of adoption in terms of exploration and expo um exploration about exploitation about um the technologies this is how you see a lot of application level um you know startup actually coming from the Asia side like the some of the very cool apps like menace like love um the new idea actually the new paradigm of thinking is coming from Asia and that would still be a in my opinion a pure play hardcore team of people who are building a service that could be used around the world right and that's like a you know Silicon Valley kind of prospect in London hopefully in Singapore Right that's right and so as at Sapiens where are you betting in terms of where you can lead Well it's some of the our product is still at a stealth stealth mode but what what I can tell is we want to um you know first of all we want to build the next generation of workspace and community okay we want to really bring social into onto the table so where's where's the a lot of people ask me asking me what where's the AI version of Facebook with H version of Instagram um Snapchat a lot of very new application level cool things are not coming just yet we're still at as at at age of productivity and uh the social features I think for next two three years will be a very strong very fierce arena and Asia might have the chance to take the lead all right so where I want to go next is thinking about I think what is maybe on the minds of a lot of folks in the room you know there's been an amazing amount of noise to signal or hype to signal when it comes to AI what do you guys look for in terms of figuring out when it's like a real AI startup or it's a startup that is actually say doubling down on AI and what you're looking for in terms of the moat There's been a lot of hypotheses out there right Like is the moat in an AI startup really the data Is it you know how quickly you execute Is it something about branding or or you know leadership where where are you guys making the bets in terms of where this is going to come from and how we cut through the noise Akash I'll start with you this time okay so on the hype versus reality piece I I have a pretty interesting anecdote like I say everyone knows the movie right Everything everywhere all at once right That some similar just position of those that's the AI hype cycle right Yeah it is hype and real at the same time right And this is very unique again to AI uh I would say today on the underlying technology we are probably at the iPhone 5 or 5S which is probably the best that ever came out from the iPhone uh on the application side we still probably at a iPhone 2 or three right uh when it comes to penetration and actually extracting business value and economic value out of AI in truest sense and not just money going in and just very experimentative revenue i think probably we are in the early days of AWS or cloud error so that's where we are so it is everything and everything every everywhere all at once when it comes to mo uh very frankly I think at least having been a founder before I think moes emerge over time right modes for anyone who's building I if I was my only two cents of advice would be if you're a founder anyone asks you what's the mode tell them I don't know and I don't give two hoots about it it will turn up when it turns up right It cannot you cannot manifest a mode from day zero there is only one true mode by the way the only true mode in venture or in a company is NFX pure NFX is the only known mode to mankind there is no other mode which is sustainable beyond that brand modes or brand NFX comes second a distant second how would you orchestrate NFX on day zero You can't if you're building something it shows up it happens right Everything else that people talk about data modes everything time and again over the past four five decades we have seen those are not modes they don't last they don't work that's the reason every era every cycle new founders come they build new companies the only modes that you can't dislodge are NFX right so as an investor I actually don't care about it uh the only thing I look at is our founders having that extreme maniacal pace of shipping Right Cuz that's the only way a moat turns up in a business the moat is you the mo is you the mo is you it's the founder and I think that's a good point because it changes over time you know I work really closely with OpenAI and Grab on figuring out how do we find these use cases where AI can actually deliver value and I think that where we were even a year ago is actually different from what we think the moat could be right now we we are different like I I I shift my pants i I was in a short break for a week yeah before I left until by the time I came back the world changed that's true the world changes fast every week yeah what about you Hen Well the world changes fast therefore it's reasonable to be unreasonable right And uh um can I answer the second question is if I was a if I was a founder today what kind of a business I would have right And if you have stories and examples even better i want to know i mean we have 17 minutes right So um you know I think as a venture capitalist you're in the business of backing unreasonable human beings right and uh let's let's drive it from the thing right I started a I I I was the first angel investor into a a very simple business choke restaurant reservations you guys in Singapore use it choke I've sold it to grab so now that I'm not a shareholder I can talk against it right how would I reim reimagine choke Well it could be a pure agentic thing right So can you imagine You just go \"Hey I want a restaurant reservation by the way I'm going to spend 500 bucks guys and I got five people give me some reservations.\" Then the agent goes and there by the way there's now an API to use the chill platform to do the reservation but then on the other side you know the AI agent may go to these restaurants and go like \"If I have a bunch of big hitters would you be interested in that I'm going to WhatsApp you when that's ready to go.\" And so you probably need a small sales force to build the relationships but the agentic right now you're going like Bruce you should totally do this right because then and then you work in partnership with choke because that's the restaurant reseration platform here's the interesting thing you know the problem we have at Choke we could never charge more than like two three bucks per reservation because we never knew what the take was you go to the restaurant say I'm going to bring a guy going to guarantee you spend $500 per person can I get 10% of that Oh by the way if you give me 15% that guy's yours i'm not going to tell you that do you know what the take rate on that business is Do you know what the number of people you need to make this thing He's nodding really hard can somebody please build this Cuz I will and I swear I will I will I will come and see you why is that happening Well we've been waiting for a long time the LLM's out here the cost per token goes down by two order of magnitude we're very close to an AI girlfriend by the way i got my team to do it so right now it's about $34,000 to train him or her um unless you use one of the packages so it's more expensive than the actual human being but let's see where Sam goes in in in in in I mean look I use that to get the giggle but it's true you think that it's not going to happen You think that somebody's not going to figure out and say \"Oh hey you're an attractive human being give me the rights to digitally clone you we're just going to scrape your APIs you own the damn thing and then we'll run it for you i would pay $159 a month for uh that's it yeah I think I think I think $15 that's expensive netflix is 19 right So your cost to serve has to be like 60 bucks right now we think it's about you know three and a half $4,000 of electricity so we just need one more order of magnitude now we're at 300 another time 30 digital human beings are going to turn up in two years time so my point being is that the platform is set right So we've got wonderful human beings making the platforms but in the next 18 to 24 months a lot of people are going to use these platforms to re-imagine existing things relationships restaurant booking uh you name it personal assistance so I think the agentic thing is very interesting now would I pay 100 times revenues for that business Maybe not but I'd pay a nice number that business could be worth a lot of money yeah even more in India and I think the only only slightly controversial addition to that piece I would add is uh I would go one step further i would say that hey why do you want to build a booking platform right Why do you want to just solve that You don't need uh eat it take the entire thing build the next uh Domino's build the next McDonald's build the next uh landmark right You can do that you have that opportunity now now obviously it seems slightly controversial because you're going after the small and medium entrepreneur or restaurant but hey if you're a founder if you have large ambition that is at play now you couldn't have done that earlier for two reasons one and I used to say this when I was a founder I I used to tell my business teams that hey the time that I respect the most is my developers time right I'm not going to ship a single line of code where I don't know what happens right because that time is precious today and I won't be and I actually cuz I I've been a developer myself all my life I still do it every day uh that time and value for shipping code is going down it I think it's already 110th for the best developers I think it go down to 100th wow and if it goes down to 100th imagine all the things that you couldn't do earlier if you were building a business you can do all of them now there's nothing which is stopping you code is not the limiting factor code is not the rate limiting factor anymore and if that's not the case go after large profit tools i love this like AI basically increases the kinds of problems we can solve increase your ambition like just just like I used to hate paying for Salesforce right I used I still had to pay it as a founder i used to hate paying for it because I used to say \"Hey what is it It's Gmail plus Excel and for that I have to pay because my developer is busy building something else right He is busy building my core platform.\" Yeah but you don't need to do that anymore u we actually I actually quoted my own agent CRM for my business over 40 last 45 days yeah Bruce so now we've heard from a lot of the investors you're of course in the trenches actually trying to build out an AI business so where are where are you trying to build out your moat How are you thinking about this problem as you build out your own venture So first of all when I think about the modes the the definition of modes um at AI word is very different from the from the um internet um word for example you talk about search nobody is doing uh everybody can every AI AI tool can do search now it's not a a real really a you know um home garden for Google anymore and if you talk about just like the services like tropes like like you know living um um you know services uh e-commerce all the AI agents can are able to do that so it's not a a tra the center of traffic anymore it's not a source of traffic anymore so I I definitely think that um on the AI paradigm all the founders and companies have have to transform ourselves first we have to be um very important you know product creator also an influencer myself sim seem like um same as you know how open is Sam Automate is trying to be very proactive on on on X account every day and you know um open has to launch their the weekly updates on the on their models to gain the the attention of the market um product innovations um attentions and traffic putting all together could be um a new definition of the mode and I definitely think that um despite all the you know um um changes in in terms of the use cases the user base are still very important if you have a strong user base if you have fast iteration of the product if you get all the attention you keep yourself on the table um on the table of the of of the poker poker game you still have a chance to compete with other players the later stage you enter the table the more difficult because the competition just get more and more fierce um so that's why I how I understand about mode okay awesome so I know that we are uh you know wrapping up our panel so I want to end with one question and then I'll open up to the audience to see to to get your most exciting questions here to spark the conversation where I want to go is your your most um controversial predictions for thinking about what changes when we invest in AI native startups or when we build out these AI native startups in terms of the unit economics do the scaling laws change in a different way that that make you think differently about how you might invest as a as an investor or how you might think about what you invest you know your capital in in those first early stages how should we be building these businesses differently I mean this is something that I think about a lot i'm building out an AI venture lab at INSAI to think about how do we build these AI first businesses what's your take on how this changes the unit economics Start with me so uh um let's talk about the cost analysis first so it used to be a lot of a lot of spending from the startups like us will be on human resources will be product innovations but right now if you want to grow a consumer app for large audience the major cost is is a GPU cost m it takes up to from our calculation up to 70 to 80% of the cost going to the GPU which is very very contradictory if we talk about the fast access broad access broad adoption of AI that becomes a um becomes a hurdle for for AI companies to um to grow their grow their revenue profit and user adoption okay so so how how we want to solve the problem potentially also a call to collaboration with local government and and industrial leaders is try our best to lower the cost of GPUs so your take is really that this is actually going to make it even harder for startups because you have these these GPU costs okay Akos I think uh I I never worry about costs right I I don't worry about costs when it comes to technology because that's the deflationary nature of technology it always will account and solve for itself uh it it has never been different in any era there is no reason it's going to be different this time uh so I think in terms of margins my the only controversial take is we're going to see far fewer companies which only live in the world of bits or which are technology only which would now start looking like $5 billion plus which in venture investing is like a benchmark uh far fewer far fewer of those right it's almost start going will start look like a big barbell where at one end you'll have companies like open AI and snowflakes and all of those and then you'll see far fewer $5 billion plus companies right but at the same time the entire listed entities or equities world is up for disruption and up for founders to take and hence you're going to see far more $5 billion plus companies which are at the intersection of both bits and atoms right That's madic it's going to be harder for just companies working in the world of bits and for a very principle reason right Like I'll throw it out to everyone which is how can you imagine me paying so you wrote you wrote a piece of code right That's what SAS was and continues to be you wrote few lines of code and you want to capitalize that for time infinity just doesn't make sense right It doesn't make sense to me at least uh and I think with more and more people and everyone in this room uh who has agency and who has taste getting to start building code and software on their own your tech models are going to deflate and what about you Han Well you have to look back 500 years ago 500 million years ago when the Cambrian explosion happened when suddenly the primordial soup created so many animals right And I think with any adoption of technology mobile was a certain point and then there was a Cambrian moment blah blah blah and there was a Cambrian moment we're not at the Cambrian moment of AI just yet so let me explain why i think your point about cost is absolutely correct and the reason for that and I given a very specific example when we invested into a fledgling e-commerce no a ride hailing business with 300 motorcycle riders you know what was the one biggest thing that we had the problem was it wasn't the app it wasn't the system I mean the app was crashing and everything was crashing right but like the mobile phone cost $300 and of course if you were grabbed and you have a car and it's $300 it was an afterthought when you had a rider who just spent $4,000 on a motorcycle but then has to spend about 8% of his you know cost on a mobile phone that was the limiting factor we had to call Xiaomi and try to convince Hugo Barrow to give us a bulk discount what happened in 12 months later Mobile phones dropped to 100 $100 we didn't have that problem and the rest is history there's always a time when the economics work and the other thing that I learned from some esteemed colleagues is that the reason why generative AI is essentially synonymous with the word AI is because the cost differential is not 10x not 100x is like infinity X right um just ask chat GPT how much would a robo taxi versus a human being taxi how much would you save estimates around 30 to 35% because you get rid of the human being right 30 to 35% would we wake up for that only alphabet would do way more right because after you do that the network effects the capex the regulatory issue you're you're can I swear again you're screwed right generative AI the cost structure right always do things 10x lower that thing is dangerous and so I think the disintermediation of knowledge or the automation of knowledge is now synonymous with AI because it's a cost advantage antage thing and that's why suddenly you know I mean you think about it before the 14th of March 2023 which is when chat GPT4 was launched to me that's the Jesus Christ moment right when everyone started putting in 150 billion of capex before that go read every single uh quarterly report I've done it right because I got to talk to high net worth individuals at UBS about why you were not smart to invest in Nvidia before 14th of March 2023 because Jensen never said AI was Gen AI it was neurallinginguistic programming what was his previous bet I'm going to power um autonomous cars i'm going to buy ARM this revolution this Gen AI knowledge revolution is less than 2 years old so what it allows lots of smaller checks going to a lot more bigger ideas that's sort of what I'm creativity it's about creativity creativity it's really about that we're about to get the camera moment i love this so I want to see if there's any questions from the audience that's burning to ask these panelists before we wrap up here um any questions that you want to ask these panelists about thinking about the next generation of AI startups in Asia Great i see a hand right there oh look at the light yeah that actually helps oh wow yeah so so yeah I do have like a question to like all the panelists so I understand now right now that sometimes when it comes like finding like AI setups and all sometimes we have to go through like not just like the regulations sometimes restrict or like something something that like and and also understand there's going to be like AI always be AI hallucinations where sometimes like the training and testing the data accuracy be quite low and and sometimes AI can also like as well so I wonder how how you like if essentially you want to find your AI or even like find the new ones essentially now you're given that the now AI agents and now there's also like artificial general intelligence as artificial general intelligence as well and how like you you guys be able to like manage this kind of issues there's a question around AGI and how they predict uh artificial general intelligence to it's not really like essentially how like management of like some hallucin things like hallucination or regulatory problems when it comes to like getting this AI as well got it so regulatory problems the challenges that come from adopting Gen AI how do you assess them as you think about building and investing into these startups Seek uh forgiveness and not permission i I think the first stuff will be non-m missionritical right So a medical diagnosis would be a hall would be kind of terrible in a hallucinatory system and then you can always put a human in the loop loop so that you know when he screws up you can hang the human but not the AI so that's actually quite easily solved so so the idea about human and AI iteration need to have a new protocol the idea is how you you can have human putting at the most important milestones uh and also the way of human AI interaction should be um birectional so that means besides um you know um like human taking the loop also taking the you know checks uh together with agents and humans hallucinate as as much as AI does humans are going to be around for a while all right you got to get somebody to hang it sounds like I mean I think that lots of questions of course open super fun to talk about this thanks so much for the questions we'll be around thanks",
