    "aggregated_text": "today my goal is to talk through specifically I think some misconceptions we have in the AI market widely uh but I'm not just going to talk about issues we're going to talk about pathways to fix them and what some paradigm changes might look like and in this world of AI models there's new models every week uh I I remember starting uh when Alexnet was the top of the leaderboard so that's how long I've been chasing uh AI and working on systems uh that could make our lives much better and today leaderboards change almost at a weekly clip um fundamentally today what what we're seeing in in the model space is we're seeing companies really build incredible foundational models but these foundational models um are extremely costly they have incredible moments of magic um and you can't deny what these companies have built is truly special but I think we're missing the outcomes so I'm going to highlight specifically some of the metrics I think we're measuring and the comparisons to that uh today I think what we're doing with AI at large uh is equivalent to a city planner if we were just looking at counting cars to build a city so if we said okay we're going to design Singapore based on traffic so let's say we have really bad traffic that means we built our city really well uh we have a lot of it we have a lot of traffic um that's interesting or or maybe maybe we base city designs on outcomes we want to have for civilization maybe we want to design cities based on experience we want to fulfill so a comparison here that I have a problem with is there's a lot of AI companies that are really building internet companies that's not really interesting to me and I think over time that shouldn't it won't be interesting to the market either uh we're chasing users are users inherently valuable in AI obviously we need consumption we need ways for these models to live but I really want us to think about this are users valuable so in the internet era users were really valuable because there was data we could extract from them um we could learn how to sell ads we could learn how to design preference systems around users and their activity but in AI specifically let's just talk chat users aren't providing you answers they're providing you questions questions are not the barrier of smarter AI systems answers are uh the more users you have in the current model the more money you lose i know this not because of articles but I know this because I work with enterprises all over the world that are trying to adopt large open models so maybe they're trying to work with a foundational model provider and they're finding right away okay this is great it solves 60% of my problem but then when I go to implement it the more adoption I get the more money I lose so you could view a cost structure as inverted today prompting doesn't pay the bills for AI companies we should be thinking about building AI systems that take away from interaction requirements so chat is such a bad interface for AI because not only is it an old design metric but it's it's a costly one because every prompt costs these companies money every inference costs us money so there's there should be much more incentive to doing what a customer or a user wants before they ask we should be thinking about how to build systems that are invisible rather than extractive in the sense that a user has to extract today from an AI to get the answer i don't know i would assume most of you have engaged with like a chat GBT or an anthropic because we're at an event called super AAI but if you haven't I think a very common pattern with LLM at large is you'll ask questions you have to interrogate and oftent times you have to continue to follow up I don't know even if the group before was talking about coding and um how that's a that's a great advent um I think the reason coding works is because developers are willing to tolerate error Uh if if you were selling these codegen tools to business experts they would be very disappointed because you ask it to build something and it's not going to build it uh it will help a developer get it done but it's not actually solving the problem it's very iterative a lot of labor very labor intensive and I I'm hearing this from customers all over the world it's so labor intensive and the amount of mental bandwidth required to get the outcomes you need are are quite significant so what does that mean for the provider if customers are asking more follow-ups and iterating is that good for AI companies no it costs them a lot more money and this is one symptom of a proof point that I think is important that a lot of the foundational model companies are building businesses as if they're social media companies or internet companies and there's an there's an analogous story that I wasn't alive for but I've read a lot about and it's really interesting uh Netscape which if you don't know was an early browser company and it was founded by Mark Andre who runs Andre Horowitz in California and Netscape thought if you look at their old interviews and like their their you know mission statements and a lot of that's been wiped from the internet because it didn't really age well but they thought if you owned the browser you owned the internet so okay I own the browser I solved the technical I a similar time building online would you have rather own stock in Amazon or Netscape i mean I would rather own stock in Amazon at that time than Netscape um there's a fundamental correlation here foundational model companies are saying \"Well we're going to solve AGI so therefore we win because we have the best model and we win.\" Very similar to what Netscape said i actually don't see that in the market at all what I'm seeing in the market is enterprises need more than a general solution all throughout history generalization hasn't been viewed as a as a highly valued metric so I don't know if you've ever heard the statement he's an inch deep in a mile wide when we hire people at WebA I'm not looking to hear that description from one of our team members from HR that's not going to excite me uh that's probably a bad signal because I'm looking to hire the best people in the world at a specific task so why do we think that building intelligence isn't going to work that way why are we okay with this idea of general when historically general has never worked um and general intelligence there's really no monolithic example of today so I'm not saying that these models are bad i'm just saying we fundamentally need them but they're not the end all beall and I think a lot of people are at this conference are talking about the things that wrap around them but I want to push this even further is the base model is not your product and it's not a product it's a gateway so a lot of enterprises that are using foundation models today have to do a lot of work on the back half to make these perform so they have to prepen prompts they have to do uh guard rails safety engines they have to write code that makes these models perform as if it was a model designed for their use case which is really interesting to me because I actually think the most realistic outcome is that people will end up making models for their use case because models are becoming so accessible and it's becoming easier and easier to train these models for solutions so what I see is more likely and this is a infrastructure we're building and we believe in and is that there's going to be an outcome that maps to civilization much more than some Terminator super intelligence living on a satellite or Stargate what I think is going to happen is we're going to have hundreds of millions and billions of contextually deep models that operate like a civilization because that's what we do so I got on a plane from London i don't I'm not based in London i was there for uh I took an Uber uber exists in London and uh took an Uber and got to the airport checked in got on the plane uh they brought me food uh went to get get some sleep cuz it's a long flight from London to Singapore we happened to land um on time and got out got to my hotel that's a really complex experience it's not just complex in the sense of the intelligence required globally but the contextual intelligence the maintenance crew the driver that knows the city uh the team that's working on the plane the flight crew that understands the safety protocols to keep the passengers safe the pilots the shift change not to mention the digital technology living on the aircraft to get us there safely all of these different forms of contextual intelligence working in harmony to solve a really complex problem we're in this metal tube flying through the air and we made it back safely it's a very complex experience and what you start to get with these contextual systems is you get these 10th% gains that absolutely reshape industries we're working with customers in some of the most interesting use cases that a general model would never solve so uh he mentioned Aura that's a great partner of ours we're working on really interesting things that will be announced soon um around bringing intelligence to the device so what does it look like when every Aura Ring user has an AI that knows them well is Chad GPT or Anthropic going to train 2 and a half million custom models for Aura users heck no so how do we get there well we have to change the architecture we have to change the method we have to change the way we deliver AI and we have to figure out how to make these things very contextual uh and then we see these gains that you would never get in the general you see all of a sudden models that understand your personal behavior and habits and you're actually willing to offer that information because it never goes to the cloud it never leaves your space it never leaves your phone that's exciting for a lot of people because a lot of people don't like the idea of not getting to contribute to intelligence and not getting to own it and have a have a say in what happens with it but when you do this you start to be able to measure what actually moves the needle for these enterprises so in my experience what's moving the needle for enterprises is there's a big difference between handing someone a solution and then going from solution to a high performing AI system and the biggest gap there is a lot of these companies want to integrate their own data and that's where all their value is the last 10% is in their data but to train a model with a foundational model company is very costly it's a huge barrier so these companies need new ways to take their crown jewel and integrate it into a system that's actually scalable so if there's anything you could take away today is that the most valuable thing still is the data that you can't find online because these foundational models have trained on Reddit all these interesting things but do you want a model that trained on Reddit in open corpus to reassemble a Pratt and Whitney engine and then go hop on the plane i don't uh I'd rather have Pratt and Whitney work with a custom model provider and make it and you know actually deploy it and we know that it's grounded and only been trained on knowledge that represents that engine so we could talk about general intelligence but general intelligence isn't actually very good um what we really are talking about when we say general intelligence is that surpasses civilization or acts like web civilization of intelligence and I'm showing I had I had to do this presentation in London and somebody said something uh after the presentation they said why did you show a dead civilization it would have it would have made so much more sense if you would have just like shown a great city and I'm like no because civilizations die like we make mistakes all the time i think we need to think as a civilization if we want our civilization to be massively successful what's interesting about a civilization model is if we distribute these models to devices so everyone in this room Web AI ships a model to your phone we could do that today we do that with enterprises all over the world you have a custom model it starts to learn you and act on your behalf and it's owned by you you can delete it it's AI you can destroy what if super intelligence was all of our models that could actually work together to solve the world's most complex problems well I think we would start to be less concerned about 30% unemployment rates from AI because we would have a role in contributing to what that AI looks like in the future distributed intelligence is resilient in every fashion so it's resilient from a national security perspective i was at in DC um in the United States at a government event and none of this is confidential so what I can share is that Eric Schmidt who invited me to the event to speak uh was highlighting some fundamental things around risk of centralized data and he said \"Well what's going to happen is when you build a really smart system either people are going to steal your model which we believe is happening globally if they don't steal your model they'll find a way to farm your model to get information that maybe they'll prompt engineer it and try to extract your training data.\" And at at last resort they might bomb your data center this is a real conversation is is this a risk if we get to an era where we're making intelligent systems that are so great what are people going to be willing to do to compromise their enemies what are people going to be willing to do to stop competitors in the space even on a business level distributing your intelligence is a resilient model it means that if we all get to participate we're making a future that's really meaningful i think the most valuable AI companies will not be measured by their users but they're going to be measured by their outcomes we're working on a really interesting project in the medical space with preventative medicine and I think there might be like 50 to 60 users globally by the time this is deployed i think it's a hundred million a year run rate line it's really interesting like that's the opportunity so when Facebook had 850 million monthly users they were extremely profitable and they were generating a lot of revenue today if you're an AI company of 850 million users you're losing $5 billion a year so I I understand that we're excited about that but I think we all just need to remember businesses have to operate with the potential to make money um uh XAI just announced that they're raising more money and they're burning 13 billion this year and they're doing about 500 million in revenue if you give me if anybody wants to talk later if you give me a billion dollars I will give you $100 million in revenue i will do it tomorrow so I think the most valuable AI will be the AI that we don't see those will be the companies that shape the next generation and I think by 2030 AI will be a civilization operating system and Web AI is facilitating that thank you guys so much for your time",
