    "aggregated_text": "hello everyone my name is Gor I'm CEO at I.NET I've been a builder from last 20 plus years I've worked in startups I've worked in big organizations like Amazon eBay HP R&D and for last 10 plus years I've been at leadership positions in Agoda as a part of booking holding group and in Binance where I've built platform for more than 200 million active users So I know a bit about building platforms In the early '90s the businesses were put up with the question if they should adopt to internet Some did survived and who delayed had a slow death We at the same inflection point now But today the question is about AI It is not a question of if but how fast you can adapt or you'll die Let's take a look at some numbers to get the clarity And in next 15 20 minutes by showing you this data and examples I'll show you and I'll prove it to you why the future of AI will not be centralized Innovation often starts from research Best of the minds will sit in a room think about the concepts create those ideas prove them and then the businesses are built on top of it That's exactly what we see in AI and LLM in the last seven years You can see the growth of number of papers being written on LLMs It has increased from 40 to 28,400 That's on the research side of things for LLMs What do we see in the enterprise side this is the kind of road map you see on the LLM side in enterprises Be it Amazon be it HP be it your Google's everybody's working on their own foundation models I am willing to bet more than 50% of the people here are either creating their own models or taking advantage of AI in some form or the other So the race is real the adoption is real But you'll be surprised to know of a number that the fundamental thing to this AI which is compute the GPU without which the AI cannot survive the adoption of AI and the production of GPU are not meeting There's a 2.5x delta between the adoption of AI and the production of GPUs Why because there are only a handful number of companies who can create these GPUs There's a talent issue there's a raw material issue there's a tariff issue and this delta is not getting reduced We're in a big problem in the coming time and this particular problem is aggravating Let's take a look at the numbers which people normally like that can we make business and money in this market of GPUs and cloud in the next few years it'll become a $2.5 trillion economy just this comput and cloud even if you make 1% out of this you're a $25 billion business so the market and opportunity is huge but still there is a fallacy going around among builders and users And the fallacy is in this market that these new strong model like deepseek will kill the market because they're so cheap I'm here to tell you it's totally on the contrary This is exactly what we need to have a exponential growth in this market Why because we have all lived through it We have seen it happening but we can't correlate The mobile phones you have in your pocket is 10 to 20 times stronger than the desktops you had 15 years back The software we write today is much more optimized than we used to write 10 years back But yet the CPU business has 100xed in last 15 years If that's the case why the market didn't shrink because there is a flywheel effect in such a business And we are seeing the same thing in GPU What is that that when the cost of experimentation meaning trying out new ideas goes lower people try out more ideas When people try out more ideas more successful businesses are built And when more businesses are built they need more of those resources which historically was CPU and in future and already is happening are GPUs So now what's the fundamental problem and why do I say that the future of AI will not be centralized Let's take a practical example Let's say you're a builder and you are a blessed builder You're not like a normal person You've been funded money You have the money You have the team You have the vision You want to move fast but the moment you'll start executing the reality will set in the GPUs which you need to get access to that when you go to these big hyperscalers you have to complete KYC and long processes you have to wait for weeks if not months to get the compute which you want even though you have money and in our business time lost is opportunity lost business lost and you're not only competing ing with the market forces you're also competing with the deep pocketed enterprises like OpenAI and they get the preference to the stronger models through these hyperscalers which you want So in short what's happening in short you're spending a huge amount of money You're competing in one of the most technological area in the world with a lower grade hardware against deep pocketed enterprises You're basically being set up for the failure And people who are here from some time and there are senior positions they can tell you that when these big enterprises go to these hyperscalers they get 50 to 60% discount for these GPUs and the compute but startups don't You will not like this example but it's a reality Have you seen an elephant with a small thread on their leg right from their childhood they're trained that they can't break it They're systematically brainwashed and they just feel that that's the status quo We as builders have been trained in the same way We believe that these discounts can only come these cheap prices can only come when you have millions of dollars of compute demand not as startups And we as a company are here to challenge that exact status quo And that was our vision And if you ask why these hyperscalers will charge you money the the example they'll give you is to give you the compute We have to buy these huge lands or rent these huge lands create these data centers hire huge teams buy a million worth of inventory And when you pay for this compute obviously you're not just paying for this compute You're also paying for this upfront cost But tell me when you use a Uber or a Airbnb or a Booking.com product when they have to give more inventory to people do they do they buy or build a hotel from scratch does Uber buy cabs no they just aggregate That's a scalable model That's how the businesses are built Scalable ones But the money in this industry is so huge that we've been taken to a direction which is not in a benefit of the builders but in the selected few companies hands So what's the solution i've told about the problem the background The solution is not to build these trillion dollar data centers The solution is very simple A deepen decentralized platform infrastructure And to be honest it's not a very novel concept It's been done historically in other industries I just gave an example in the case of hotels Airbnb and booking.com did it aggregating all the inventory in case of cabs Uber has done it now we realized it that this is possible I've been part of that industry in past as a part of booking holding group we have people from Uber who have created these networks but it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to create this network we knew it either we could have created a platform waited for a couple of years three years taken $100 million plus $200 million plus of funding and created this network because we have some people from the crypto background also like me from Binance We thought let's use a tokconomics and we use the web3 tokconomics gave away hundreds of millions of worth of incentive to these suppliers to create one of the biggest networks of GPUs in the world now what do you get out of it right and how do we do it you'll be surprised to know similar to you have your hotels right historically people whenever they want hotels they'll go to Marriott Hayat which charge a bomb but you do know for a fact that there are other hotels much cheaper with the same quality That's exactly the case in GPUs also You have the tier 2 data centers You have software companies who have basically bought $1,500 million worth of inventory have created their models but now they don't want same number of models They want to rent it out but there is no platform So these second and third year data center these software companies we aggregated all this inventory and give it to people And you remember these big giant enterprises when they go to hypers scale they get 50 60% discounts So meaning financially it's possible it's just not you We made sure that you are including it in those prices as a platform We have availability in 138 plus countries Every AI builder knows that the closer the model is to the user the better the experience is And we are much more scalable compared to the centralized player any day for getting a supply There's no KYC You can get your GPUs not in weeks not in months in 2 minutes Cost you save 70% cost Sometime people can't relate to it Let me give you an example If you are a $20 million funded project which is a big number if you ask a AI project normally 50% of the of their funding goes in these compute and infrastructure around that Imagine out of 20 million you're giving 10 million in this Now if you can save 70% out of it you're saving $7 million Imagine how many engineers you can hire how many data scientists you can hire how long a runway you will have how many ideas you can iterate This is exactly what a builder of the future needs All our hardware is Sockto compliant basically creating this platform brick by brick vertically integrated meaning first we created this network of GPUs which we gave you for 70% cheaper but now when we're building this intelligence now meaning we just launched two months back our inferencing platform and because it's running on the 70% discounted inventory this particular product is 70% cheaper So we basically wanted to give back to the community because they got gave a lot of support to us So we basically create an inferencing product pulled a lot of open source models gave it for free to the builders and we wanted to check our product make it stable before we take it to the enterprises and we were so surprised there's such a huge demand for this product that within 2 months without too much marketing because we wanted to make the product stable in the meantime we like literally got surprised we were basically getting billion plus tokens in no time no time we had a community of 5,000 plus active users within the last 2 months right and then the demand started coming for new products training So now as a part of super AI we're launching a new product for training where you can set up and use the whole platform within a minute We are a tech team and we're here just because of the members we have We're 100 plus engineers We have people from Google Meta VMwares AWS Ubers And that's what has enabled us to be at a place where we are We have a simple moto We make it easy for anyone anywhere to access the tools to develop AI through reliable affordable and performant platform Very simple I know there are a lot of web two people here so they might not be able to relate to it but it's a reality And the reality is that they give example of the elephant with the thread It happened in the case of money also in past and Satoshi in the Bitcoin world when he was creating a bitcoin he wasn't just thinking about money He was basically creating a concept and that concept was that the power which is in the hands of few could be given back to the masses Innovation should never ask for permission and shouldn't be controlled And decentralization makes sure it never has to If we don't own our intelligence today we will not own our future tomorrow Decentralize AI and own your future Thank you",
