    "aggregated_text": "bio intelligence applications of general generative AI in healthcare and biotech i'm going to be your moderator today my name is Alita Masab i'm a general partner at DCVC dcvc is a Silicon Valley based venture capital firm we invested about $4 billion at the intersection of AI and deep tech that includes lots of companies in the healthcare biotech and diagnostic space i'm also author of Superfounders a book about startup founders and what makes them successful but today it's all about these three gentlemen um we will talk about from basically hype to reality is this the time where AI has actually been deployed in healthcare biotech pharma and diagnostics so I will go through the panel uh Munjaw is co-founder and CEO of Hypocratic AI they use generative AI for healthcare delivery alex of Incilico Medicine they use generative AI to design new molecules and biologics and Mahiar co-founder and CTO of Deep Cell and the applications of tools AI in tools and cell diagnostics um so with that I think each each everyone in the panel would love for you to go a couple minutes talk about the genesis of your company what the company does and where AI comes into play and then we'll get into the meat of the questions uh so I'm on anjal sha um uh hypocratic AI we started the company actually in like March of 23 so we saw chat GPT and honestly um as a uh person who had studied AI and built two AI companies and then built a healthcare company I said oh wow we finally have AI that works and so it's time to start a company around this and so uh we started Hypocratic what we do is we provide healthcare AI agents that operate uh predominantly within the scope of nursing um reaching out to patients talking to them on the phone doing care activities um and we sell them to health systems to payers which are insurance companies in the US and to pharma and so uh that's the company we're based in uh Silicon Valley we've raised about $270 million in the last 24 months alex Aliper president of Filico we we're a global biotechnology company we discover new drugs new medicines against agent related disorders cancer fibrosis metabolism disorders and we developed a platform geni platform that helps us discover drugs more efficiently and faster so currently traditional pharma spends billions and over decades to get a single molecule in the market we want to change that paradigm because we need more medicines uh fast and uh we have been able to demonstrate that we can shorten the time frame for drug discovery three times so three-fold instead of 5 years we're doing it in 18 months and we do we're doing it at fraction of the cost so currently we have 30 drug discovery uh programs uh 10 of them are in clinic phase one phase two and our recent phase two study in lung fibrosis have just been published in nature medicine where we showed efficacy in patients with IPF lung fibrosis and it's the first case where AI discovered molecule has shown efficacy in real human patients so yeah that's our business model platform and pipeline and I'm Salg I'm co-founder and CTO of company called Deep Cell um if you think about well we're an iteration over microscope if you think about microscope as an eye we are an eye that is empowered by brain tells tells us like what you see and an arm that tells you like well if you see something that's interesting you could actually take it out so you could actuate on that so that's a deep cell product we empower uh bioharma companies understand like how drugs affect their um the underlying cell samples we empower diagnostic applications clinical applications and we've recently commercialized globally perfect so first question what I want to understand is what did you have to invent offtheshelf that was that was basically not off the shelf right what did you have to build yourselves in this time of AI that there's lots of companies with lots of products of AI out there that already exists yeah you know the um the primary challenge of what we're building is one it has to be extremely safe like even a nurse talking to a patient on the phone can kill them if they tell them to take ibuprofen and they have chronic kidney disease stage three or four and we couldn't have the AI mostly get that right it has to never recommend ibuprofen to a CKD 34 patient 100% of the time um the second issue we had was we realized that voice was the only way to truly canote you care the empathy and emotion you can feel in voice is quite different in fact part of our thesis was that there's a voice renaissance coming that it's such a natural emotional way to communicate with patients that you're that that's how we're going to do it but you have a very small latency budget when you talk about voice in fact you look at all the models that have been improving lately um the you know from deepseek onward to the latest uh Gemini 2.5 they've done it by increasing latency in fact so much so you can't use them for voice like you can you have to get an answer in 500 milliseconds for voice so we had to work on a whole host of new technologies to allow you to make a smart safe AI that answers in less than 500 milliseconds from the LLM standpoint and we did that with a unique architecture so we came out with a new unique architecture we call the constellation model where it's 22 models working together we came out with uh a new way to actually do inference that speeds up inference time of especially large dense models to ensure we can meet that 500 millisecond limit including a very novel thing we call vertical quantization um and on top of all that we had to come up with a clinical validation system on the back end because nobody tests the output of LLM they say oh my LM safe this is what I trained it on i'm like how do you know have you seen PubMed GPT trained only on PubMed highquality content still make stuff up all the time and so we actually are the only ones where we hired 6,000 nurses to do uh 300,000 test calls to the AI and mark every last error and we only shipped it when it was as safe as a human clinician and so there was a lot of pieces that we had to kind of figure out to do this perfect Alex well we started back in 2014 and it was a cusp of a like generative AI revolution right so Ian Goodfellow published the uh GAN paper and we immediately started working on applying generative algorithms to discovering like new drugs generating small molecules and at that time 2015 2016 nobody like even knew what generative AI was so we had to like pioneer this field so first peer-reviewed paper on generative chemistry we published it in 2016 where we generated uh drugs molecules against cancer from scratch um using generated fedricerial autoenccoders and um since then we kind of pitched this to big pharma and at first people were aggressively skeptical saying it won't work but then later on when we showed validation and uh some results we kind of were convinced and now every single university like even lazy professor has a like AI drug discovery uh program so another challenge what we had to overcome so in our space it's not ch you have no idea if a molecule if a model generated would work until you actually physically make it and test it so we had to spend a lot of time and resources to go in the lab to experimentally validate the output of each single model and every validated model we included uh the the model into the platform and build a platform uh which is currently being used by half of the top 20 big pharma companies there you are yeah so what did we innovate on so we are at this very intersection of AI hardware and biology each of them very hard when you combine them together extremely hard um actually we hired from autonomous driving uh engineers the reason is that so so remember so we image these cells they're flowing very fast and based on the image we decide where they should go so imagine it's almost like a car driving in this like micro road where you see all these particles and you have to decide okay so this go that way this go this way so it's really an autonomous driving uh problem at the micro scale so we had to do a lot of distribution of computation across different layers of you know GPU FPGA etc and then each of those particles are these like tiny fragile viable cells that if if you mishandle you lose the biology so there there was a lot of innovation at the intersection of all three that we had to overcome interesting seems to me from kind of Mjal and Yar the the main thing that's not off the shelf is like if you need the accuracy and you need the speed you need to innovate yourself you can't just buy it off the shelf something that has lower the the latency that you require and the you know efficacy that you require um next question about regulation we want to talk about FDA and CMS and all the you know bodies that regulate healthcare and biotech have they really kept up with the pace of innovation are they helping are they hurting maybe we start from that side yeah so historically regulatory bodies have been behind um uh the pace of AI well I guess that's for everybody right you know we're all all catching up with AI but regulatory is especially slow uh with that said I mean there has been some positive movements over even over the last few months uh you know we saw FDA they uh published this uh uh PCC uh PCCP guideline January of um 2015 2025 where you know we and and there is this you know uh in the US there is this bill in the Senate that is uh about the um health tech which is as recent as April so there is a lot of movement but it's still historically uh the pace of AI is faster than anything else that you know is happening around yeah I would say for FDA I think what they're doing this year is pretty remarkable and pro- innovation right on top of uh like recent uh announcements we've also deploying like Genai platform across the organization every organization due to be completed by the end of this month i think that was announced um and that would allow importantly to reduce review cycles on drug discovery drug development programs so typically the bottleneck right now with the FDA is the review time like process right how how long does it take the FDA experts to review an application to review a clinical trial results and provide guidance on what to do next to a pharma company so this will have a chance of uh improving and accelerating the review cycle so we'll have the rap more rapid um turnaround process and more rapid u progression of clinical trials yeah you know one of the reasons we picked um our agents focus to not be a doctor and to not diagnose is that keeps you out of the clinical decision support requirement within the FDA so that was one thing but second even if it had if it hadn't you know the FDA today is um you know uh having met with uh Dr draws on the CMS side but as well as um RFK they're very forwardleaning on AI both of them i mean extremely forwardleaning so I think in the US at least there's a very pro- AI administration um that's making it easier and paving the way for a lot of um uh easier time but I I think on the flip side in Europe the EU AI act is just a total nightmare like here's Europe thinking we're going to regulate first before we even understand what the thing is and I I'll give you an example so if we add one feature to our AI agent it's actually going to make it the highest risk within the uh EU AI act and that feature is that it senses the emotion of a patient reacts so you don't want my nurse to say you know uh my AI agent to say um to be able to tell the difference between you saying \"My back hurts and my back hurts.\" Cuz those are very different things and the agent should absolutely notice the difference but if I make it do that it's now the highest risk requires the highest approval and I think they just weren't thinking and understanding the issue when they made these regulations and oh by the way the fine is 7% of worldwide revenues and it's written so vaguely you're almost 100% going to trip it and so you look at all these things and you're like you know so I've had so many clients come to me they're like can you please deploy your product in Europe i'm like no I'm absolutely not going to deploy it in Europe when you guys change this law give me a call something that I I was reading about recently about FDA and about them kind of being pro pro AI there's hundreds of thousands of submissions to to the FDA every year from medical device manufacturers pharma and at this point just because AI is helping create so many different things they're also having problems kind of just parsing through all the documents that comes in so they are starting to kind of apply AI on FDA's term to actually be able to parse through all these documentations and submissions that's encouraging yeah it is i think it's pretty good um now we want to talk about AI and a little bit of the highend reality right what do we think AI can actually change in healthcare in biotech in diagnostics in in your basically area of expertise and then what do you think it can probably never touch or not touch in the next 1015 years so I know this is going to be uh an interesting comment although not surprising I guess i think generative AI in at least the use cases we're looking at is probably underhyped and the reason I say that is when you look at nursing in the US there's a huge shortage and so you could say I'm going to come in we're going to help solve some of that shortage but the really big idea is not just doing things you do today right when the cost of something drops 10x or 100x you do novel things you never did before so for example in the next heat wave in the US we're going to be reaching out to every single one of these 200,000 patients that this one health plan has identified that are at risk we're going to call them we're going to do a heat stroke triage we're going to call an Uber then and get them to a cooling center if they're having issues we're going to do that at the hottest two hours of the day every single day of the heat wave now you could never do that with humans you literally couldn't you'd have to find 50,000 nurses to call people at the hottest two to call 200,000 people at the hottest two hours of the day with what 5 days 10 days advanced notice of a coming heatwave and it would cost you 2 million of 5 million to 20 million to do that every single day well are you really going to save that much money on ER admits probably not but with AI you can do it for $200,000 a day in fact in the next generation Nvidia chip comes out it'll maybe be as low as $50,000 a day and that's at our retail price not even at like the true COGS underneath it and so when you look at all that you're like my god there's a level of outreach and care we can deliver that's amazing now on the what shouldn't you do i don't think we're going to get an AI doctor anytime soon i think it's too hard i think you're going to kill somebody um even um there's other areas that I don't think are safe to do it we do not let our agents do mental health because it's quite ambiguous you know if I do a check-in call for a congestive heart failure patient I know the questions I got to do was your ankle swollen did you gain more than 2 lbs like there's a protocol and if I follow it I know I've done the standard of care in mental health it's pretty squishy oh you said your dog died oh you didn't follow up on that and then therefore they hurt themselves you know you should have follow well okay it's not a clear protocol um we don't do any under two kids work we don't do any um uh high-risisk pregnancy work so there's like you know we don't do any hospice work the very end of life requires a level of sensitivity that's extremely hard in fact I asked one of our our team I was like you know it's um our AI struggle to do it and they're like don't worry man well actually 99% of nurses don't do end of life hospice work because it's also very difficult to do and so there are some things we're learning not to do but the biggest one is I think we're a long ways from an AI doctor that we will all trust and the and the system will say is okay interesting that we have solved empathy before the decision-m right yes well I mean diagnosis is hard yeah i mean if I asked everybody here you know raise your hand if you've ever been to a doctor who misdiagnosed you and you had to go to another doctor like that's like almost everybody's had this experience and so even the humans get it wrong a lot for sure so well in in terms of my opinion what AI can do right we're in biotech and we already show that AI can discover drugs faster and cheaper currently if you take last 15 years it we have 50 drugs on average that are approved by the FDA like every year 50 drugs it's kind of plateaued whereas we have thousands of diseases without a cure we have rapidly aging population and because of that we have rise in incidents in chronic disorders despite all the advances in cancer treatment we have more cases of cancer globally and it is increasing just because people live longer so we'll have a very kind um challenging prospect in front of us so we'll have to face the music at some point right so and address this challenge so AI offers us an option to accelerate the drug discovery process and discover more medicines not only therapeutics but also preventative solutions right so you have both like the shield and the sword uh to tackle that challenge so AI can already like provably de demonstrabably uh accelerate that process now in terms of what AI cannot do I agree that some of the kind of morally challenging issues like um you know reproductive health decisions end of life decisions but those decisions will be made by humans some of the aspects related to empath empathy although AI can love you unconditionally right so like it's the best kind of um love you can get you can get from AI um it's still in some cases it will fall short and will have kind of um downside and also AI cannot control anything with relates to like politics right and so economic decisions that are made by people by politicians in the healthcare space um so it cannot really improve something that it cannot control so I think like yeah morally laden uh issues and social economics politics related in healthcare would would not be touched by AI yeah let me ask a follow-up question there so AI is helping us generate thousands of prospects for drugs right you increase the top of the funnel you know they go through the different stages of the clinical trials at the end of the day you still need vet labs and animal studies and human trials right and that's the part that you know AI can't necessarily create more humans to for trials or find more patients for for trials do you think AI can actually help us get there too or we are going to have lots of you know a huge pipeline which kind of gets blocked when we need human testing yeah currently have 99% failure rate in drug discovery and drug development right so it's one one out of 100 cases they succeed uh so if you just increase the heat rate with AI you will be able to overcome this uh challenge if you get 10 out of 100 it it will already increase the number of approvals 10fold and um you know speaking of a scale we have shown that in order for us to discover a developmental candidate the molecule that will go into humans we need 10 times fewer molecules to be synthesized than required conventionally right for our lead molecule we synthesize less than 80 molecule to generate a clinical candidate so I think that kind of precision and multiparametric optimization that AI allows us to perform will increase the heat rate and ultimately will increase the number of approvals per year okay in terms of what is underhyped what I'm most excited about is the following you know over the past couple of years we were amazed by how chat GPT became so articulate and like told us stuff that we never thought AI could do or like you know generating voice or like recognizing faces all all the like classic uh problems remember those are the problems that we are evolved to do well what we're not evolved to do well is understanding the DNA sequence understanding the uh gene expression of our of our cells understanding how the cells look like and right now like over the past couple of decades we have built tools to be able to read all that data now imagine you take that like fire hose of you know transformer architecture and like everything that fed LLM to inside to our bodies and like let let our body all that data that we can read feed a kind of model i think this is entirely underhyped because all of a sudden we we we would have a super intelligence we're talking about like when when we arrive at super intelligence we we can have super intelligence today with the methods of understanding our entire biology and that's what I'm you know super excited to do in terms of what we cannot reach i kind of agree like the decision making well for two reasons especially around the the health around the AI doctor is um is a little further one is well we are all control freak we can't really hand off decision making like even if the AI is a legit doctor we cannot just hand off the decision making to that B we don't really have a good way to detect biases and all the stuff that could go wrong in the underlying model and uh we don't have a way to ask good questions about like explain uh how the AI does imagine if we ask the AI doctor why do you came up with this um diagnosis and it gives you like a 100page explanation is that going to be usable for a human no and that's and and imagine based on that that diagnosis you have to make a decision of well am I going to prescribe this pill or this drug this critical drug to this patient or not nobody has the time to read that 100page description so I think for those reasons it would be very hard to have an like fully autonomous AI doctor anytime soon thank you data your AI models or your distribution question is which one if you and you have to pick one right is is the reason your company would remain successful and basically have have defensibility modes is it data that matters your AI models that matters or your distribution the second AI models your AI models interesting um it's it's everybody thinks oh if I just have you know he who has the most proprietary data is going to win building the best model not really no i mean we had 10 billion tokens we got from health system partners we got another 6 million calls of patients talking to to that i mean pretty good proprietary data um it turns out these models are trained on the whole internet they kind of know everything and in fact when you train them too much on data they they kind of um they overfit pretty fast and so I I don't think it's data the way people think i think that's like a that's like a leftover from classifier AI days where the AI knew nothing until whatever data you gave it to train but here it's been pre-trained right that's the beauty right gpt is generative pre-trained transformer it's pre-trained and it's pre-trained on the whole internet and so I I think that people have not realized like every time we think \"Oh my god we're probably gonna have to train on that.\" We ask our model and oh it's already in there i don't know where it came but it's in there somehow so I I think that's the the part I mean I I think distribution in this market doesn't really help you because people are very interested ultimately in having the best safest product um so at least for what we're doing safety matters so much but I don't think that's always the case like you know um if I'm trying to use generative AI within my Google Docs and maybe there's a 5% better if I actually use Open AI directly versus the Gemini that's already built in eh I'm just going to use Gemini it's close enough i just I barely have to click a button it's like half there it's even suggesting things on the side versus Open AI I got to take the whole thing paste it over here take that result put it back in maybe that changes the formatting i got to fuss with the formatting i don't have the time it's not it's not a big enough delta for that but I think when it comes to safety it it matters um because even if our product is 99.9% safe and the next product's 95% safe and it's half the price you still get fired for killing how many people in that 4% right so I mean I think that uh uh for us the model safety i.e the model itself matters the most interesting that's probably one of the more counterintuitive responses that I've heard that the models matter more than data but I know everybody says this data thing i'm like dude that was true the old classifier models were idiots savants they knew only the one thing you trained them so yes but this thing kind of knows everything great to hear alex how about in drug discovery data models or I don't know what how to define distribution in the pre kind of market trials maybe it's your it's your vet lab or you know patient recruitment or clinical trials yeah I would I would say in drug discovery in general it's also the model and but the model that the algorithm plus the overhang that is required to train the model like we see in you know deepseek reinforcement learning pipeline so those modules that assess the quality of the out model's output and provide feedback back to the model those reward components are extremely important that allowed like deepseek to uh train so efficiently um so in for drug discovery we developed hundreds of those reward models that provide feedback in reinforcement learning loop back to the model and allows allow to train in some age cases however um where we're talking specifically about domain domain specific foundation models there the data can be even more like more important but just in the specific foundation model cases where we're dealing with extremely nuanced data type uh but in general I think like model itself is yeah is the core I guess I have the boring answer I for us it's the data u so today we have the largest data set of single cells on the planet three three billion plus images of single cells but that's not what matters like we we've painstakingly have gathered that and well published this first foundation model but the more important piece is that every single customer of us that runs our system adds to our data set and adds valuable annotations to our data set and that uh data flywheel is what matters because even the if you have the like largest resources of the biggest companies in the world you cannot keep buying your data you have to find a way that you get paid while you're gathering your data and that's what matters for us very cool um AI is bringing the cost of intelligence low basically human intelligence cost is going super cheap what emergent use case does it enable do you think in the world of healthcare or just even outside of that like what does cheap intelligence mean for the future of the world so you know I mentioned it earlier when I talked a little bit about the heatwave use case but I think for the first time in human history we're going to be able to get to true healthcare prevention that this abundance of health care workers right because I have an infinite supply of workers at almost zero cost and I can finally reach out to every patient with whatever frequency I need to do and the ideal staffing in the world like in the US there's you know 360 million um people and there's about 5 million RNs but the ideal ratio is probably 360 million RNs for 360 million people that probably yields the best outcome but we can't afford that obviously and not everybody wants to be a nurse i mean there's like many things that don't work but with abundance we can finally do it so there's a saying of you know an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure the problem is it's actually the reverse a pound of prevention is worth an ounce of cure because the cost of intervening has been so high and such short supply and now I think for the first time in human history we have this ability to check in with every patient every day if we want you know my my mother got was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure and she ended up going to the hospital with a blood pressure of 230 and when we got there we were like \"Huh how did this all of a sudden happen?\" And her doctor looked up in her medical record and was like \"Oh actually your mom's been on a blood pressure lowering medicine for the last 5 years.\" I'm like \"What?\" Cuz when I talked to her she was like \"Oh I saw the doctor he said \"For my age I'm the healthiest woman he knows.\" I mean she just totally just you know told her family that she was totally fine when in fact she had this and she didn't take it and she didn't get refills and sure enough 5 years later she ended up with mild CHF and I'm like God I wish the doctor had called her cuz he's the only one that knew because of US HIPPA laws if she doesn't tell us we don't have any other way to know uh and as a child you feel so awful you're like \"My mom was there for me and I can't be there for her what should I have done i should have checked.\" Like you know you feel so guilty but really the doctor could have called her you could have said \"Hey you didn't get your refill ma'am are you still taking the blood pressure you know it's really important that you take you know can you take your blood pressure from me right now and they could have done that every single week for the last 5 years and we might have avoided this that's the power of what this abundance is going to deliver for us and I think all of human history we've been thinking about healthcare has been premised on scarcity like I think you go 4,000 years ago to ancient Greece we did not have enough healthcare workers so even the word triage assumed scarcity and I think this shift to abundance is a massive paradigm shift that honestly we've never done before in healthcare well in terms of productivity on our side you know the program I mentioned lung fibrosis program to get from zero to preclinical candidate to actual molecule it took us costwise around two and a half million US dollars the industry average is in hundreds of million to get to a developmental candidate so we show like almost 100fold decrease in uh cost of the underlying kind of drug discovery efforts and since we started working on the pipeline since 2019 we have been able to nominate 22 candidates clinical candidates so just to put it into perspective the typical pharma big pharma with tens of thousands of work workers in R&D generates four or five candidates a year right so with AI we are able to kind of match the productivity and even some in some cases um uh exceed the productivity of big pharma players so I think the abundance in terms of AI it's already here we just need to accelerate further start more programs um for those like thousands of indications that are unmet um and also preventative uh options so we want to prevent diseases from happening and um both prevention and treatment are essential pieces of that and AI can help with both thank you one thing I'm very excited to see is finally we're going to pay attention to rare diseases because of abundance of intelligence like you know we have we have this expression in the field like variance of unknown significance what does that mean is well there is a variant in your DNA but we don't know how significant it is and I think well and in general like how does the science work like you know we have it's all pattern recognition and it's a distribu it's a fat tail power law distribution and what we know what we can do as a a scientist is to just look at the uh the early part of it to look at everything that fits within our attention our lifespan our time in the lab with AI being available and being abundant and being central centralized we could look at the fat tail we could look at everything that so far we've been ignoring because they're just too rare we we don't really care so that's I think that's that's a big shift in the entire healthcare 100% so we have about two and a half minutes we're going to do a lightning round very quick answers question number one what is one healthcare biotech or diagnostic problem you wish someone else would attack i don't want another co so I love an AI that tells me hey like you know this is this is you know radar for the the next pandemic yep dx I would say data sharing clinical data sharing across institutions currently like data generated in silo silos and hospitals and very few countries have developed a centralized solution so I would really like AI to help with integrating healthcare data across countries on a global scale uh I think that there's a novel set of preventative things we haven't even thought of um because we've never had a cost of an agent be zero and I I actually think I hope and it's a creativity limitation so it's not that it's like we have to think of whole new things we never thought of before and I'm I'm hopeful honestly lots of smart people will will figure that out what is one smart one startup cliche you never want to hear again well I think those companies who just say \"Well we have a lot of data we're going to sell it to I don't know pharma sell it to X and they're going to figure out what to do with it.\" I think that's just like if you have data you have to know what to do with it yeah I I agree with that plus maybe one like cliche i think yeah one can adjust is just put putting more focus on total available market and making it as large as possible i think it's not this should be a very narrow market that for a startup to to begin with right so TAM it should be very focused and you shouldn't grab like large TAM number uh thin wrapper companies will fail every VC ran around with this sam Alman was like \"Oh my god thin rapper company's gonna fail.\" And then cursor like what yeah so I mean you have perplexity you're like \"Huh did you just say that cuz you didn't want anybody to start those?\" Cuz it certainly turned out to be dead wrong you know i mean we're doing more than that but uh it's shocking how much just a little bit of specialization really you know gives you like the other day I was playing around with new haircuts and there's an app that does that great now yes I can do it in the horizontals but actually the app that does it does it just it just good it's just better and I think that a little bit of specialization um just makes a big difference amazing well perfect thank you so much for the great discussion today guys um I hope AI can you know help solve rare diseases generate more drugs and molecules and then help deliver healthcare to everyone in the US and abroad thank you everyone thank you thank you [Music]",
