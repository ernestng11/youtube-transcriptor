    "aggregated_text": "i'll give a quick intro kubernetes is basically the fastest growing technology on the infrastructure stack uh it's growing at 24% annual growth rate currently 60% of enterprises have already adopted it and that number is projected to reach 90% by 2030 uh it's already powering some of the biggest startups and uh tech companies that you use every day and this is a space that we know well uh throughout my career I've built and sold three businesses and I've never met someone as passionate about tech or software infrastructure as my co-founder Caleb he's had a two decade career in DevOps uh he built some of the original tooling when Netflix migrated to AWS he's a contributor to Terraform and he's ran a DevOps agency out of San Francisco for 10 years uh two years ago he realized two things kubernetes maintenance had become 90% of their workload and uh Kubernetes cluster upgrades were a huge pain point for them with no great tools so these upgrades that I mentioned they're really critical and necessary hyperscalers mandate them every uh uh 6 to 12 months and if you're a compliant company your SLA will will require you to stay up to date uh also these are huge costs for companies in North America an average Kubernetes engineer costs over $200,000 annually uh and they can spend up to 30 to 40% of their time on cluster maintenance globally the cost of this maintenance is upwards of 12 billion annually so that's why we chose upgrades as our wedge so I'm going to tell you a little bit about why upgrades is such a nightmare most teams still rely on spreadsheets or teamsp specific processes often patching together brittle scripts across YAML Helm and Terraform to get things done so every upgrade becomes a little bit of a gamble is it going to crash production is it going to break dependencies or worst of all is it going to cause any downtime and that's the status quo that we set out to fix so CubeGrade improves the entire upgrade process end to end it scans your clusters maps dependencies checks compatibilities and pushes safe upgrades via GitOps so there's no human error no downtime and especially no spreadsheets our product makes the upgrade cycle up to six times faster and can reduce up to 70% of manual DevOps work uh Cube Grade is completely cloud agnostic so we work across AWS Azure GCP Alibaba and even on prem so wherever your clusters live we can manage them but upgrades are just the beginning for us because infrastructure is not about it's not just about staying up to date it's about staying efficient staying compliant and staying secure and we realize there are deeper problems that teams face infrastructure is often overprovisioned or misconfigured cloud bills are spiraling out of control compliance gap often show up at audits which is too late so we're building something much more powerful we're launching an intelligent visualization layer that lets your team see what's running and why and we're also creating AI workflows to address things like cost attribution and optimization right sizing and autoscaling security and compliance enforcement troubleshooting and solving errors these workflows don't just show you the problem they fix it under the hood our AI agents read your infrastructure they plan executable workflows and they push them via GitOps to keep a human in the loop and they can also roll back automatically if any problems arise under the hood our MCP gives agents real-time cluster understanding and context rack pipelines inest YAML Helm Terraform basically everything DevOps touches our orchestration engine executes changes safely and predictively via your GitOps pipelines this is a gentic automation designed for Kubernetes and infrastructure as code execution not just alerts confidence not chaos and I'm excited to introduce my co-founder and CTO Caleb uh to give you a quick demo of our product unfortunately he is based out of San Francisco and he couldn't make it today but this is his air time here's a quick walkthrough of the coupe great platform at its core Kubrate helps you visualize your clusters and then take action whether that's upgrades right sizing security compliance or troubleshooting we integrate with your existing GitOps pipelines so you don't have to change the way that you do cluster management you start by connecting your clusters via our convenient oneline script or our Helm chart once they're connected you'll have access to a visualization dashboard where you can organize your clusters into different environments like development staging production you'll quickly spot issues across clusters and then you can dive into specifics we also give you a much deeper level of visibility this is where you can focus on one specific resource or across a namespace to identify issues in a cluster when issues do show up uh like deprecated APIs misconfigurations or compliance issues you're not on your own our AI agents use our own MCP server plus MCP servers from GitHub Terraform and others to get the context that they need to take action in this example we're looking at a cluster that needs some upgrades the agent reviews the versions and then proposes an upgrade plan which details exactly what needs to be done once reviewed you can generate and submit pull requests directly to GitHub from there you can inspect the commits review the code changes and then choose to upgrade using your existing infrastructures code pipelines everything we do is designed to keep a human in the loop we don't force full automation on you because when you're dealing with critical infrastructure that's risky instead we automate the heavy lifting and then give your team full control at every step that's CubeCrent AI workflows for Kubernetes purpose-built for upgrades compliance cost optimization security and troubleshooting let's make Kubernetes accessible to everyone and skip the boring repetitive parts of cluster management so how do we bring this to market we're selling directly to enterprise and we're partnering with system integrators and resellers we soft launched this April and already have several large enterprises negotiating pilots with us which we plan to launch by Q3 we also signed our first client for 24K ARR um what's interesting though is that our outreach to demo ratio is really high proving that there's a real pain and teams are actively looking for a solution we're currently working to list on AWS GCP and Azure marketplaces to accelerate our growth so if you're feeling the pain of managing clusters or if you have R&D budget for AI or infrastructure let's talk you can scan this or visit our booth over there we're cube great the AI agent for Kubernetes life cycle management thank you love it very strong product market effect so this will definitely work my only question or concern here is um what sets you apart specifically in terms of you know AWS Google ourselves we're building similar agentic behavior respectively sending a lot of folks towards serverless models so away from Kubernetes potentially so I just want to hear your take on it but for someone who's using Kubernetes I know the pain so this this makes a lot of sense well yeah so for now we'll have to focus on people still using Kubernetes because you know there's still a large chunk of market share over there and if you're comparing us to sort of managed services within AWS or GCP we kind of help companies that outgrow those managed services because for example they're using controllers or add-ons that are not covered by those managed services and that happens a lot with compliant companies that have service meshes or might be running on multicloud or even have an on-prem environment and those those people are not covered by hyperscalers unfortunately so you talked about other um technologies that are not Kubernetes right do you think that in 5 10 years what percentage of enterprises will still be on this technology wow i'm asking to make predicting predictions on stage uh we're still seeing large growth in the Kubernetes space so like I said the Kaga right now is projected to stay around 24% until 2030 so the idea and the projections are that 90% of enterprises will be using Kubernetes in some capacity doesn't mean all of their workloads will be on Kubernetes but as long as they have some workloads on it we can support those workloads yeah just want to understand what is the what's triggering the urgency in your customers is it um the the downtime or is it compliance pressures or Yeah those are all great questions and and the the initial product that we built which was upgrades was usually the urgency there was compliance and downtime those were two big ones um so those were mandated like I said by the hyperscalers but also their compliance SLAs's meaning if you sort of run like at a vminus 3 on your Kubernetes at some point AWS is going to either drop you or charge you five times more to support you so basically you're kind of forced to upgrade and if you're a compliant company your SLA will mandate you to be at V minus one at the very least because all the security patches are required to be up to date",
