    "aggregated_text": "good afternoon everyone Uh my name is Zui I'm the CTO of of Nanyang Bologics or NYB.AI for short And today we're transforming how we discover new chemical compounds which makes uh drug discovery uh faster safer and more reliable So our company is a spin-off from Nanyang Technological University uh we developed our own proprietary AI model It's called DTIGN It predicts the bioactivity which basically means like how a chemical compound would interact with your body So this helped to uh faster the identifications of high potential natural and synthetic compounds for FGMA and consumer health So what's the problem that we are solving to get a drug asset out to the market it takes around a decade and more than $2 billion of R&D Yet only 10% of it actually make it So traditionally pharma needs to test up to like billions and billions of compounds And so you can see laugh testing is a major cost driver Using O AI we reduce this time from years to just months And this is an issue not with just pharma but also consumer health as well because both built on the backbone of finding the perfect molecules for their drug or applications but they lack the smart tools to pick the right ones So recently both have turned to AI to solve the problems So as of last year almost $10 billion in 12 mega deals was signed between AI uh and big pharma And so just recently some of you might heard about the collaboration between L'Oreal and Nvidia and how they're using AI to supercharge beauty So you may ask like how the hell does AI supercharge beauty right well for us it makes perfect sense because AI can help faster the process of finding the compound interacting with your skin or your body which improve your health and also your beauty So back to our model we train our model based on the 3D um interaction data between the compound and the protein inside your body Um but it's the protein inside your body is ever changing throughout the day So we look into like um environmental aspects such as like pH level or temperature and so we built a neuro um a graph neuronet network um predicting the bioavity So here's a brief demo of a platform Um you can see um it is like a search engine for novel compound So you put in like the sort of like the target disease you want to um focus on and uh the platform will scan through like all millions of uh compounds and then find the the most suitable ones for you So we benchmark um we published a model on E and we benchmark oursel against uh other leading methods in the field and right now uh DTIGN is 27% more accurate in terms of biotivity predictions So this translate to a huge saving time um huge time reductions and also high higher um rate efficiency in picking the correct compounds So how do we make money so um first of all it's a two-stage process Um so we focusing first on natural compounds opportunities in food supplement and consumer health So this will be like short-term projects uh which provide us with early cash flow The reason we're focusing on these because it's not as rigorous uh as like doing drug discovery So you don't have to pass FDA approved uh but you just need to prove that is um safe and not toxic for human consumptions This is also a good validations of our platform Um which leads to stage two which which is that after we have uh developed like successful drug target will work with Fakma for big drug discovery projects So we will generate revenue through upfront SAS fee Uh this is usually um take into account like the number of um target disease uh or client want to solve and how many compound they want to scan uh milestone payment and then once the product is out to the market we'll do a revenue sharing So um we um start commercializing our model uh as of last year Um so in less than a year we already got like some pretty good tractions and already got uh revenue and paying customers Um so in Japan we are doing psychiatrics uh neutrauticals Um and in China we're doing compound discovery uh for traditional Chinese medicine Uh so you may ask like how do we go to market because B2B sales is a pain in the ass to do Um so we decide early on that we want to work with uh ecosystem partners such as Nvidia um hip package enterprise and equinix um so we work with these guys and they introduce us to partner uh to clients in the pharmma or like uh healthcare space and they don't just introduce they bundle our AI as a software to their hardware So this you can see this create like a virtual cycle whereas um client is happy because they got access to our AI um or partner is happy because they uh they can sell more GPUs and then also our growth is improved as well Um so just want to take a look into some of the case study of a real projects that we're doing Um so we work with um congorit in Japan uh called Japanese tobacco So basically they want to find substitute to nicotine And so they they asked us like hey uh we have this um we have this problem and how can you find the compound in nature in plants that help to reduce stress but not like addictive And so we look into like um receptors in your brain that target uh mood swing And then we train our model based on those um targets and we scan through compounds through our database of more than 50,000 tropical plants And so we shortlist a few candidates that act on mood uh related targets for them So this project takes around like four months for us to finish and um the revenue is around a few hundred,000 Um so currently we already have a few of the top of the candidates for them and now we are advancing into uh validation to refine efficiency uh dosage and safety for human consumption So I just want to go through our road map and key milestone Um so we start developing our first version of uh our AI model in 2019 So it takes us five years to develop the first one So as of last year we start um commercializing this and we already regenerate revenue as of this year Um we also are launching our second versions of the model and then uh we currently raising our prea round uh to expand our salesforce and expand our lab facility as well So as of next year we hope to launch our newutical with the client uh through revenue sharing and then we also want to secure the first pharma client um deal in two years our team So we have a lot of experts uh in the field of biotech and also AI uh from Singapore Um and we are also supported by strategic investors as well So yeah that's all Thank you for listening and I welcome any questions Um I have a question for the the compound interaction data the compound data Is that something that you you store yourself where do you get that from that would be my first question And then second one I'm not an expert in this field but are there similar kind of companies that that certainly must be doing similar Yep Yeah thank you for the questions Um so for your first questions so uh for our training data uh we script the internet for research papers on like interaction data between uh compound and the protein inside your body Um and so that's our training data but we also uh build our own natural compound library So the reason that we are focusing on uh on natural compound library because nature is familiar to us here in Southeast Asia and then we also believe in the sort of like the healing capability of nature's and also um we work with uh traditional Chinese medicine companies um where they they have they know like why jinseng works but they don't know what compound inside jinseng actually works So we also help them with that Uh put your second questions So um first of all there's a lot of drug discovery companies um but drug discovery is a huge pipeline So we're focusing right now on the screening of the compounds to reduce the billions of compounds to just three per se and currently we are the most accurate in terms of biotivity predictions and we are constantly improving our model uh because of that Yeah I'd love to talk about your assets You were talking about this natural compound library Yes that you've built because we're currently in Asia So you've got access So what's the plan to get that to become a global natural compound library yes So we're actually um going to release our paper um in December on on that natural compound library Um so we're focusing on on that um using AI to automate the process actually So one of um one of another biotech company I I I know uh in Vietnam they it took us they took them around like 10 years to build a comp uh like a library and then they usually have like um PhD students to annotate the papers So right now with the race of AI we uh delve and fine tune or LLM and then like um just screen through that to fasttrack that process I see that you have a couple of revenue uh streams Um which one do you think is the highest potential yeah Highest uh sorry could you repeat that uh which revenue stream do you think has the highest potential yes Um so um basically um we we work with uh both like FAMA and consumer health alike because we see that um although like they may have like different requirements it all boils down to finding the compounds and so that um help us to basically um structure um a deal in a way that's is SAS So based on how many compounds and how many targets they want to do um we just do based on that and so I I think that um maybe it's a little bit confusing that maybe it looks like it's different model but it actually boils down the same operation stay the",
