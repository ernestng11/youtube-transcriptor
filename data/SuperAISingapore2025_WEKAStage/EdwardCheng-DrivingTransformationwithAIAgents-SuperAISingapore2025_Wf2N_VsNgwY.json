    "aggregated_text": "i think uh super AI is perhaps the most exciting event that I had uh attended this year regarding AI i'm so happy that there are so much momentum excitement uh particularly with a lot of startups thinking about applying AI and uh giving the benefits back to their customers you might be surprised what is Oracle doing here particularly Oracle Netswuite oracle Netswuite is actually an ERP suite so it has finance HR uh asset management inventory management e-arketing e-commerce basically is the software that allows business to run their back office operation so many of our customers are in both the small business as well as the mid-range market particularly 60% of companies going to IPOs in the United States are our customers so today we have 41,000 logos 41,000 customers using Netswuite every day every moment running their business the question is then what are you guys doing with AI particularly with AI agents what exactly do you guys do and how do you use AI to help us in doing our business so I think that is the purpose of this call now we only have a very short time so what are we going to talk about in order to understand how Oracle Netswuite is approaching AI and giving that benefit to you uh as users customers of the software i would approach it from three angles now you might feel like being in this uh conference I fully understand what AI agent is but let's take a look at what it is and then I will share about very briefly how Oracle Netswu approach AI generative AI and AI agent and then finally I think the most important thing is the following and that is many of the speakers in the conference had talked about one major reason that would deter deter or slow down the adoption of generative AI and AI agent is the risk and so the question is how do you do save AI agent now the first question regarding what AI agent is perhaps the easiest way to think about it is by looking at the characteristics that define good AI agents right i think the the the way that you can approach this is by thinking that with generative AI basically you have uh perhaps a free Stanford MBA working for you as a consultant or or in the way that Singapore would say it would be a free N US uh MBA graduate working for you as a consultant now with AI agent basically you have almost infinite number of Stanford graduates working for you in different fields at a very low cost right and so you can approach this by thinking if I were to hire this people to work for my company as contractors as consultants as employee how would I define that this is a good employee that is the way that you can think about AI agent and I would say perhaps there would be four areas you can think about what is a good employee number one obviously is effective communication so an AI agent would be very effective easy to understand you and you would understand the agent by using natural language and real time translation the second area obviously a good employee would be selfinitiated they would he they would be very proactive in doing work for you so the technology that we developed in this area is called situation awareness so the AI agent would not wait for you to tell it to perform work but it would observe the environment and perform work for you and that is exactly how Oracle Netswuite work today thirdly it would be domain depth so whoever you hire in doing your work whether it is a travel agent it is a a finance agent it is a tax agent it is a HR agent you want that agent to have indepth knowledge about your company and also about that area of expertise and that is what AI agent would be and finally I think it's also very important is the flexibility that it can adapt to uh a variety of environment it would be able to handle anomalies and ambiguity in such a way that it would not throw up its hands easily by saying I don't know how to handle your problem but it actually at times might loop in the human to make the judgment call so those are the characteristics of good AI agents now then let me quickly show you at Oracle Netswuite how do you approach how do we approach AI at Oracle Netswuite we don't do bolted on AI meaning that we don't build AI features one by one but what we do is we build it from the ground up and so there are four layers that we build the first layer is the infrastructure layer along with our model partners so there are various foundation models that we use in uh man manifesting the AI features depending on the use case so we might use GPT model we might use llama we might use cohhere for the uh some of the enterprise applications and so on and so forth right with that then we build the AI services that you can see the services are multimodal depending on what exactly is the use case that you are dealing with then that area of the AI surface would get click in thirdly we have the platforms enabling you to do further development or you just adopt a certain model to be used to solve your problem and also it allows you uh to have uh crossplatform interoperability so as a result you can have external agents that might be coming from let's say Salesforce.com coming into the Netswuite environment and combining the information and return a report back to you and then of course finally the last layer would be the agent application now with all this is already very exciting as a matter of fact 99% today 99% of the seuite executive claim that in the next couple of years they would absolutely invest into doing AI agent in such a way that they can gain the benefit now however a high percentage of these executives claim that the only factor that is blocking them between ripping the fruits of AI agent and where they are today is about safe AI and so survey uh gave us the data that although 99% of the executives claim that they will invest more in the next couple of years in order to rip fruits from generative AI and AI agent however out of the same group of people 67% of them claim that the potential the thing that that keep them up in the middle of the night is the potential error that AI or AI agents uh will make and so it is because of that at Oraconets with the way that we do AI is that we keep safety responsibility and trust in mind so today generative AI has entered uh enterprise mainstream absolutely is creating disruptive change across all industries and AI agents capable of reasoning planning as well as uh proactively executing tasks are redefining how work gets done in companies now also AI agents are increasingly integrated into a wide range of enterprise workflow spanning various applications and uh uh playing different user roles however as this systems becoming more uh powerful with more capabilities the stakes roll higher left unchecked AI agents actually pose risk such as uh hallucination uh misinformation bias or with misalignment uh with intended goals it is because of that it is critically important that you balance innovation with responsibility we need transparency uh in agents uh operation clear accountability when things go wrong especially we need human oversight keeping human in the loop at the right moment right especially in uh trust sensitive domains such as finance HR healthc care and any compliance related applications now again remember innovation without responsibility is unsustainable however if they are properly balanced AI agents actually can be a powerful enablers helping you to transform your organization with more agility insight and productivity so welcome to the age of really transformation with AI agents perhaps this is the first time maybe other than God has created intelligence we human has also created intelligence and for the next couple of years for companies and organization that can swiftly adopt safe AI into their uh uh work stream absolutely they will reap the fruits of AI agents however for companies who fail to do that they would be doomed to become irrelevant so I hope that in the rest of the day you would find a little bit more time to visit the Oracle Netswuite booth uh in the AI arena and we can further discuss and exchange about how Oracle Netswuite can actually partner with you to put more AI into your organization and return the benefits to your customers thank you very much",
