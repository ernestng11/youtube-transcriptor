great valuation so on and so forth but it is also that this industry is making a very valuable impact on the real world so that is what I'm going to show you uh with examples from across Amazon so yeah some quick terminology familiarity so Amazon web services provides you AI products in three form factors ready to use easy to integrate and easy to build and host what I mean by that if you use Q series products you don't have to code you can just use them or if you are an application developer enterprise developer uh you want to be able to integrate AI into your application uh then you can use easy to integrate platform Bedrock which provides you a range of models and last but not least if you are a model builder like Anthropic you can use the GPUs and the tranium chips that Amazon offers so with that terminology let me show you the broadest choice of models that Amazon offers so when this revolution began approximately 2 and 1/2 years before people had this mistaken impression that one model can do it all but it hasn't been true there are different models with different strengths so Amazon spotted this possibility way ahead of time and we designed our strategy not to focus on one model alone but to provide the broadest choice of models to Amazon customers so there is a range of uh models that are available and there are many more i couldn't fit them on one slide okay so let us see the impact that uh this technology is having at Amazon so first of all uh let me share some numbers with this technology we have been able to already save uh effort worth 4,500 developer years at Amazon that is equivalent to $260 million US uh around 350 Singapore million Singapore dollars right so that's a massive impact and we are seeing that 80% of the code generated by AI tools that we have is readily acceptable 20% of course it needs reviews and testing and all that but 80% is a massive number this is a brief uh view of QLI product it is built with uh cloud model in the back end it can help you not just write code it can help you think through your problem statement it can help you design your architecture write code write test cases run those test cases test your code and even deploy it okay so this is getting easier and easier and we believe this is going to democratize technology to such an extent that we are not able to imagine i'm very excited for the hackathon that is going on today where people are using this tool to build products please stay around to see the result of the hackathon okay so what Amazon does is uh while we serve probably a billion customers we also serve tens of millions of merchants from across the world from US from China from Southeast Asia from India amazon is a platform with lot of features when you are a merchant you not just directly go and sell the products on Amazon you first do some R&D you decide what kind of products you want to sell how many products you think could be sold so should be there in the inventory then you plan ad campaigns for the products right so it takes getting used to the platform because there are just too many features so what we thought can we do something that will make using the entire Amazon platform super duper simple for millions of merchants and hence we launched this project called as project AIA so as a merchant you don't have to have any background expertise in hundreds of features that Amazon platform provides you can simply go to Amelia you can chat with her you can ask her how to prepare for the holiday season or if you are already running a business on Amazon you can talk to her to figure out you know how the business is doing uh you can also check the supply chain status with Amelia so there are so many things you can get done just by talking to Amelia so we believe this is going to make entrepreneurship much much easier we are not just stopping at that we also are helping people be creative with displaying their product while staying real like different merchants have different skill sets there are mom and shops on Amazon who probably don't have as great skill set with digital art or imaging etc so if they want to display their product say for example here a toaster is being sold it doesn't look that appealing uh among millions of products available on Amazon it is not going to catch anyone's eye but what you can do is you can use these generative AI tools that Amazon has provided to build attractive imagery for your product that stays to the dimension and the look and feel of your product but at the same time it shows it in the user setting so users can relate to the product so these products from a Chinese vendor are being put in a scenario of a Thanksgiving dinner being cooked which American uh you know buyers are much more likely to appreciate so we are putting generative AI to use uh and it is being used by millions of merchants on Amazon already next one Alexa so Alexa was a pioneer it was the first device of its kind to bring voice AI into your homes and Alexa has been extremely useful to me but uh while Alexa was great at speech it probably wasn't as great as understanding because it used to have predefined skills and as long as you ask something that was possible to be done with predefined skills it used to work well but other times it used to get confused so what we have done now we have taken a pause we have taken a step back and we have redesigned Alexa not just with improved multimodal voice model but also all the intelligence that LLMs have to offer so you can now talk to Alexa as if it is your friend and it can do lot of tasks for you extremely varied type of task for you because it is powered by Nova agents so let me show you a brief demonstration wow wow look at my style i know we ain't seen it like this in a while oh hey there so we can just like talk now i'm all ears figuratively speaking do you know how to manage my kids schedules i noticed a birthday party conflicts with picking up grandma at the airport want me to book her a ride billy Eyish is in town soon no way i can share when tickets are available in your city yes please got any spring break ideas somewhere not too far only if there's a beach and nice weather santa Barbara is great for everyone i found a restaurant downtown I think you'd like what is Santa Barbara known for it has great upscale shops and oceanfront dining can you go whale watching absolutely want me to book a catamaran tour wow what's the next step remove the nut holding the cartridge should I get bangs you might only love them for a little while you're probably right make a slideshow of baby teap mom what part am I looking for again 2in washers your Uber is 2 minutes away for real wait did someone let the dog out today i checked the cameras and yes in fact Mozart was just out in a while wow launched it in the US uh it will come to Singapore and this part of the world in due time but it is so much more like a real person it is so much more capable powered by generative AI and Nova agents now we have been talking about all the use cases in the virtual space what about the real space the real world so thanks to the super AAI organizers uh they were very uh particular in getting physical AI people uh like unitary person P persona AI etc here age of robots is upon us if you see those unitary robots uh the stability that they offer amazing amazing right this technology is going to be everywhere very soon so robots is the future for rest of the world for Amazon it's the present amazon has the largest number of robots compared to any other company in the world amazon has 7 thou 750,000 robots in operation every single day amazon ships billions of products uh the warehouses can be one mile long the products in a single order can be in different corners of the warehouses it is robots who go and bring those racks to the picker who can pick them and pack your orders that task cannot be carried out by humans who would otherwise require to walk 30 kilometers within the warehouse every single day right so that's why Amazon had 750,000 robots working in their warehouses but the problem with these robots is that they didn't used to have tactile sensation okay so robot's job was to bring the racks to the person who is going to lift the item of the rack out of the rack but the problem is handling items is very hard like there could be a book there could be an iPhone there could be a toy there could be some item made up of glass handling them requires different application of force right so Amazon has been working on something called as Vulcan robots so Vulcan robots have the tactile sensation they can precisely understand what is the object how much to push how to so it is making space to put that box there and it knew it can press more because those items were pressable if it were glass items it wouldn't be pressing them does that make sense so it's a very complex problem to tackle that Amazon has managed to tackle uh to a great extent and one of the things uh I wanted to show you uh this particular demo in this particular uh conference is because to train these models you need lot of data the models that run these robots okay how do we get this data data is a major problem for robotics the way data is easy for video models or LLMs it is not the case with robots okay so we have been using generative AI to generate synthetic data to train robots again this is like again tens of billions of dollar worth of application being built with generative AI at Amazon agents what can they do here claude is operating uh Blender for me blender is a very complex tool for 3D design but I don't have to know the 3D design process i don't have to understand different features and functions of Blender claude it is thinking out loud and it is operating Blender by using MCP connector mcp was a protocol launched by Amazon partner anthropic so this is what is possible the kind of democratization of the knowledge that is upon us we can't imagine so this is where we are headed uh last year we just chatted with AI this year we are handing over tasks to AI to be done autonomously and robots uh AI was able to work for few minutes now it is able to work for few hours and uh in 2017 and beyond that uh AIS could help us do true pioneering innovative work so while we are moving in that direction again this is projection by Amazon partner Anthropic amazon invested large sum of money and we are helping them with building their models so Amazon launched these two SDKs to make it easy for people like you who cannot focus full-time on AI to be able to build agentic applications so note down these names i don't have much time left so Nova Act SDK is a great tool uh that can help you browse browser based applications so if you want to have uh an agent that can do meeting scheduling for you restaurant reservation ticket booking so on and so forth you can use Nova act because it knows how exactly to operate the browser just like a human does and uh beyond that if you want to have additional capabilities you can have strands SDK that has been launched by Amazon so last few seconds agents are amazing okay but agents need to think long it results in generation of lot of tokens okay so models need to run really fast so at Amazon we have massive focus on making models faster and faster and faster so this is just one example this is a benchmark done by artificial analysis noa micro was the fastest model for them we similarly work with clot to make their models faster we are also building chips that make running models faster at the same time more power efficient and cheaper and we are investing a lot in renewable power because agentic applications are going to require massive amount of power and it cannot be done without massive amount of power so with that I just want to remind you as we say at Amazon it's still day one we haven't seen what is totally possible in fullness of time so it's very exciting time to be around and probably when we meet again next year we will have much more exciting stuff to show that we can't even imagine this year so with that I would like to end my speech and thanks to the superai host for hosting me and sorry for exceeding my time a bit thank you",
