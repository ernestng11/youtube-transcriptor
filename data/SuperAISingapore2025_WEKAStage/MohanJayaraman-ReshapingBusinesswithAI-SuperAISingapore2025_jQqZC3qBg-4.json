    "aggregated_text": "afternoon everyone uh great to be here and to be talking to you uh I thought I should take a minute or two to sort of credentialize why you should be uh spending time here uh going through the content that we are going to go through over the next about 10 or 15 minutes while we get started uh Bane for those of you who have not been aware of it has had a bit of a ringside seat as far as Genai is concerned AI is concerned over the last uh few years given our early involvement with OpenAI we were the people who worked on uh their enterprise strategy got things together for them at that point in time and we're super excited by the technology subsequently we've been involved in close to about 450 odd builds where we've taken organizations from concept through to production i've personally been involved in close to about 30 plus of these builds in in the region and hence what you'll hear from us is a little more of a point of view on what it takes to get an organization uh through to production what it takes uh for actual scaling up of these systems how do you sort of separate the hype of what's uh out there in the market to the reality of what can be done right now and what we wanted to do was uh introduce this with a very quick view on the way we are seeing the AI evolution happen uh for those of you who've been in the space uh nothing that I'm calling out here is a surprise i mean we started out with traditional AI that's been working on uh everything that's deterministic over a period of time moved on to genai uh in the 21 to 24 period actually the the work there started perhaps another decade back but it culminated in all the effort that happened around the genai space for those three or four years and then we are starting to hear more about agentic AI right now uh what these are these phases are doing distinctly are giving us capabilities that we did not have in the previous phase and uh if I were to sort of place this in perspective the first uh phase basically gave us the ability to work with deterministic data for deterministic outcomes and gave us a lot of capability to look at information and structured information in a very productive way the second phase with geni basically let us look at uh nondeterministic uh outcomes and with unstructured data in a much better way producing content looking at new things that we could do what agentic AI is now bringing all of it together uh in also bringing uh capabilities that can span a workflow uh to look at what for example AI agents with autonomy can do so what it's doing beyond the the face that genai gave us is autonomy it is giving us the ability uh you know for instance to work uh by itself uh on a set of information that it holds and better itself over a period of time and in that sense gives us a lot more of agency compared to earlier phases that we had in play with that as context what I wanted to do was consolidate the discussion today into six topics uh that I wanted to uh talk to you about what enterprises at this point in time in terms of perspectives on AI are thinking about and what it means for them uh the first part of what I wanted to talk about is related to uh you know the way organizations are looking at this as a transformation uh and then each of these topics will sort of layer on uh on the the messages there let me start with the first one which is uh to talk about the whole theme of uh a multi-year transformation and what's playing out there the first part of what's playing out is most organizations are looking at AI in different phases so look at you know for example 2023 as the phase when we actually had experimentation on uh there was conviction that you could actually get some potential uh applications developed uh there were uh themes around you know what you could do as a long long list of use cases there were a bunch of PC's uh that were put out and organizations got into the play uh largely looking at these PCdriven approaches uh to look at proving out what the technology could do 2024 uh there was a little bit of a view around early scaling uh and that has meant for example uh the fact that they are starting to look at a few more select use cases and uh looking at trying to see what they could for example uh use to bank value i like the way for example uh Dell articulated it in their uh in their CTO's podcast recently where they talked about the fact that they started with about 800 use cases when they got to the first phase and then they brought it down to about eight of them that they thought would give them business value in a shorter period of time and that was the shift where they started looking most organizations started looking at where they could bank the value the third phase that's playing out as we speak is uh centering around agentic AI and is largely revolving around what you can do to business processes as a consequence of this technology for example as we speak we are working with large uh insurance organizations we are working with uh banks we are working with manufacturing organizations where we are looking at processes end to end and looking at what can be done uh to uh shorten the process that's associated uh with uh you know their major flows uh and to look at what can be done by way of efficiency there we've looked at uh you know core processes like sales like recruitment and we are able to see that there is uh more uh than a uh you know 60 70% reduction in time involved uh at the same time a productivity increase of close to about 3 or 4x that you can bring in so we are not talking about trivial changes that can happen in flows but we can talk we're talking about substantial shifts that can happen in the way organizations are looking at processes 2025 and beyond and this we think is fundamentally defining the way organizations can put their strategy around uh the transformation journey that they can look at with AI and 2025 on we almost think about this as a period when AI will play a role that's beyond what traditional RPA did uh think of this as RPA on steroids uh with the ability to be able to work almost in isolation almost as autonomous agents to do what people are doing uh assisting them to be way more productive than they could ever be the second part of what's playing out is this whole theme of what we talked about as uh big bets uh I talked about the fact that organizations are starting to look at big bets these are basically translating into four broad themes uh one is business use cases that can have material business impact on them so these are not edge use cases where you're trying to use uh let's say GPT for writing a mail or uh you're trying to use a large language model to generate a content piece of content what you're doing instead is trying to take something that has tremendous business value uh and trying to see if you can actually institutionalize this for example we've worked with uh processes like procurement with organizations where we've banked close to about a 3 4% saving on already what is a large base of uh saving that they have in play so for organizations uh that have a close to about a billion dollars of spend we've actually seen they have uh the ability to bank close to about 50 $60 million of additional value in a short period of time using the capabilities that AI can give and these are the kind of use cases that make a difference we've started using this in areas where you know for example we are putting this as a front-end tool that's available to uh let's say relationship managers on the wealth side and we are starting to see that give a tremendous amount of value uh almost increasing productivity by 50% almost increasing the amount of leverage the number of customers that these wealth management manage man managers can handle by about uh one and a half to 2x we are seeing them use this for strategic differentiation where uh you know for example if there's a way in which you let's say have a process that's running for about uh 10 days uh to resolve a customer complaint we were we are talking to a client who wants to be able to resolve this uh in an hour uh and we think it's tangibly something that is doable in the agentic framework now uh a reduction of a 10day uh uh process of a customer uh complaint resolution into something that's about 9 days is not huge value but to be able to substantially shift it and bring it to about a half an hour or an hour is something that gives them strategic value and differentiation and that I think is a big part of what's uh playing out the third part of what is going on is uh to look at this as processes that you can simplify again I mean the idea is not to take existing processes and overlay digital on top of them but to look at you know what could for example play out with lower number of touch points what you would do say for example in an insurance claim process to let this run as a process that uses human in the loop but uses AI agents to actually make the process run a little faster and as a consequence give you a lot more and we are using this for scalability across functions and geographies and I've given you a few examples of the way this works for example in contact centers for example in personalized marketing uh for instance in sales automation for creating collateral etc in claims automation and so on what this means is as a third message we believe that as you look at these processes over a period of time using AI we think it'll move from human processes that took a certain amount of time to human in the loop processes to human curated processes that will give you a substantial amount of lift and a huge amount of leverage and we believe that the substantial amount of saving that we're talking about is not a 20 30% change but like a 2x or a 4x change that you can make in people productivity and in the amount of time that you're taking to run some of these processes it's worth looking at the way as a fourth message how organizations are trying to get these initiatives going just given the context of the fact that this is playing out in two different places uh one is a place where you are building applications that requires a certain amount of uh governance uh it's requiring a certain amount of curation a certain amount of structured capability and uh what this is giving us is also a bunch of capability on the other side with tools like uh a chat GPT or a Gemini which are able to give you through deep research capabilities a power user that we never saw before so this whole concept of what we call a lab and a crowd is something that's starting to play out the lab is basically focusing on creating some of these products in a structured way with high governance and with uh technical capability whereas the crowd is largely taking forward use cases that might have lighter touch uh simpler ability uh you know to put products together a lot more of what we are starting to call wipe coding uh to be able to put simple constructs that can actually create a power user group unlike what an organization has ever seen in the past the fourth part of what we wanted to talk about is uh that um organizations are starting to also redesign their processes for the fact that consumer uh adoption of agents will happen in a big way uh it's paradoxical but it's worth pointing out that we did a recent piece of work where we were looking at uh you know the the uh uh web artifacts of a large organization and uh we thought about the way these artifacts will be used in the past versus the way they'll be used in the future the past largely humans looked at these you and I would look at these websites and we would compare it whereas in the future it's likely that there'll be more agents looking at this so as we looked at this we found that parts of their business that had more complexity that had built more layers of uh you know complexity around the way they presented data seem to be less accessible to the agents compared to uh you know the parts that uh were accessible uh with simple data so the reality is a lot of our web for uh consumers today has been built on the basis of what we think is built for the human eye rather than built for uh an an agent uh or an AI agent uh that's actually coming and crawling for data and as a consequence we believe there's a lot of change that has to happen in the way organizations will need to think about it and prepare for these uh slew of agents that will come in and this is a big part of what we think uh will need to be thought about including rate limiters like you uh the captures the ability to present information the ability to look at new bottlenecks that will develop in the organization as a consequence of everything that we are seeing play out and the way to constructively trying to destroy some of these uh rate limiters and bring in scalability so with all of this I wanted to bring this together into a couple of simple messages uh consolidating the six lessons that we talked about into a few tips uh that we think are still worth thinking about for those of you who are already uh in the play at an enterprise level uh the clear message is please continue the AI push uh look at experimenting because to an extent uh a lot of what we seeing playing out is uh the productionizing capability depends on the organization's ability to experiment and look at how these capabilities play out in reality and what's the best way you can actually incorporate them into your product offerings the second part of what we'll need to get uh think that you'll need to start thinking about is uh building agents and by the way uh when you look at building AI agents thinking about how you want to pilot how you want to iterate faster and build these is going to be important the third lesson is fundamentally to set up the foundations and these might mean data foundations as well as technology foundations that you need to put in place the last two lessons are related more to people and the way I I point this out is in any of the builds that I've been working on i've possibly seen technology play about a 40 50% role and the change management related to people within an organization play the remaining role so as a consequence let's not trivialize the change management that's needed so start involving people as creators start involving the human relationships team uh in the process and making sure that they are involved in everything that's related to people transformation that sort of consolidates everything that we wanted to say thanks a lot for your time today and hopefully these six lessons are things that will be useful to you as you're thinking about your journey and the way you want to take your uh AI processes forward thank you",
