    "aggregated_text": "hello um for those who were here yesterday I'll go really quickly what we discussed yesterday uh essentially if you've seen the news lately you're seeing a lot of information about cutting edge AI but this is a story about what is happening really only at the cutting edge because the truth is most of the world uh is not able to utilize AI right now because they haven't finished their digital transformation they still run legacy technology and there's the question of sovereignty that is really bothering them we believe that in order to solve this problem we would have to create a product that has the shape of the problem itself so we build what we call industrial solver models these are models that can understand the real world from there they can generate designs that a construction company can build for data centers factories or even a new airport terminal and if you already have a up and running facility you can plug in all of your IoT all of your SCADA to reveal hidden intelligence you've had all along uh these technologies are already being used uh underground in factories in Arizona from Foxcon airports here in Singapore Richingi airport and so on and so forth uh we build this for the edge but we scale it in the cloud thanks to the technologies provided by partners like AWS we have almost $1 million of annual recurring over 250,000 inference cycle on the edge uh which is extremely significant for uh industrial use case we scale through uh system integrators and we sell through pilot to conversion and we're able to convert 40% of all of our pilots we target a market at the intersection of CAS software automation IoT and there's a dual use in the defense sector as well we have a team with very deep execution experience and we were able to arrive at this stage thanks to everyone's contributions we're about to open our seed round or $5 million uh after yesterday's pitch uh 10% of this is already allocated uh yesterday after pitching the judge had some questions about the use case of the technology at Cheni airport uh although some of the information is restricted I can tell you some a fascinating story that is centered around extracting value from hardware you've already invested in the past so the goal was to use uh security cameras that they have all around the runway to detect potential dangerous obstacles uh that could uh have an effect or an impact on safety um so traditionally you need to buy new hardware to do this but thanks to our technology they were able to achieve uh they were able to have manual verification uh by 50% and increase the accuracy of anomalies detection on those runs by over 98% uh this is fundamentally a story about how do you use the cutting edge in an environment that uses technologies that are not fundamentally compatible in these sectors they were our very first customers and today as you may know there's a new terminal in construction i would love to tell you more but uh maybe next year uh a second judge had another question about what are the kinds of uh sensors that are required to use this technology so there are two use cases the first one is someone who only has an idea i I need to build a new data center uh in Malaysia in Japan or in uh Singapore um just with the restrictions that they have for the building certifications we're able to generate a BIM file that the construction company will know exactly what to do this is a fundamental breakthrough that we will announce formally um next month but in environments where you already have uh existing systems we support technologies that are widely used today but uh Microsoft maybe stopped supporting them 90 years ago we're talking about OPC uh Modbus um and various protocols in the CCTV industry as well two questions let me start first by do you need to custom build these AI models for every customer or is there repeatability on this like for example you get the example of Changi obstacle detection which you obviously had to build since it was your first customer but how much can be reused for uh different implementations with different customers here all right so this is a perfect answer a perfect question uh essentially we sell the foundational model uh so a stock model that we're able to deliver to airports factories data centers and other types of critical infrastructure is trained purely on industrial data but what we were able to do with your company uh specifically is that the models run on the edge and these uh types of customers have a wide range of wealth coming from all of their sensors uh all the inputs that their team members um put into put by using our technology can be done to retrain a better version that is only for them so the retrain model on the EC2 instances um are the intellectual property of that particular customer so since we scale through system integrators um we can make an abstraction of all of these uh custom use cases because the refined model that they will keep improving is made by all of their contribution it has the shape of their business okay um so you mentioned that I think it's 40% of pilots convert to customers is that right tell us about the other 60% what are they doing so the the thing is um there are some certain scenarios that we've encountered particularly uh in Japan so um there are some situations where we can run the pilot but it might you might have the perception that this is too cutting edge or their culture their internal company culture would be difficult for them to to implement so uh we focus on those 40% because um it has typically they have an immediate use case they have a budget that they can allocate for multi-year contracts and uh just to go back to the 60% there's also the system integrator part where um our technology typically is sold after they buy a building management system uh and there are certain cost considerations uh involved with that as well i'd like to ask um what does uh implementation of your solution look like and how long does it take as well as you know uh the sales cycle in the front as well okay I'll tell you uh my favorite story which is the Changi airport story i arrived in Singapore one morning at 5:00 a.m and I was at terminal 2 I think uh there's a McDonald's there and uh yeah I was sitting ordered my breakfast and I only had the fire emergency exit uh floor plan to showcase the demo and uh uh illustrate the value proposition in real time so I created the demo at the McDonald's i went to with the integrator to pitch it to Changi Airport we did the pilot for 30 days and they're still our customers today uh in terms of the sales cycle from the moment where we engage um a new customer or when there's a new opportunity you can look at anything between 6 weeks if uh you're really lucky to 12 weeks if it's uh if it's a a more complex implementation the thing is anything after 12 weeks we don't typically pursue uh because uh these are projects or opportunities that we would be able to capitalize on um years in the future this is uh an amazing journey and I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without my team and particularly my wife",
