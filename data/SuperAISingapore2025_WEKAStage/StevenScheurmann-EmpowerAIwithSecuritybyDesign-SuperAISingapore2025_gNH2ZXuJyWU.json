    "aggregated_text": "for those of you who don't know who Polo Alto Networks is just let me indulge a little we are the largest cyber security company on the planet and one of the things that we do which is very very important is we collect telemetry from our 100,000 plus customers the reason we do this is to have insights and the ability to proactively see a threat before it comes and this is really important the cyberspace for many years has been reactive our position is to be proactive the reason I share this information with you is Gen AI the adoption of AI is one of the newest threat vectors and landscapes which hackers are highly focused on our role as it relates to artificial intelligence is to provide the visibility that's key to provide the confidence so your customers your cohorts your citizens your employees are using the AI products with confidence and lastly the trust so visibility confidence and trust my presentation is about not stopping the adoption about of AI it's about how to harness the possibilities of AI without being compromised and this is really important because most of the hacks we see in the world at the moment are related to the adoption of AI and we have to understand this so here's what's very interesting and this is a little bit outdated but imagine within 2 years 1 billion people adopted some form of AI app app that's quite phenomenal it's mindboggling we have never seen an adoption rate this quick ever and the AI adoption falls into two major buckets you will have employees that are accessing Geni Gen AI applications you may even have children that are using Genai applications to answer questions to do homework etc wrongly or rightly they're doing this and you have enterprises that are creating Geni or AI applications into their work environment they're the two scenarios that we typically see playing out at the moment now here's the interesting part and again I think this is massively understated this was in February 2024 57% of employees are using some form of public AI now I would suggest these are the instances that we are aware of there are many cases in your work environment your employees are accessing Jenna Aai and you may not even be aware of it and it's happening i see this personally myself when I'm on the road visiting customers but here's the thing there is no doubt that AI and the adoption of it helps you with increased productivity so for ourselves Pala Networks we have AI in our workplace so for example our expense claims low risk or auto approved um many repetitive tasks we apply apply AI so there's definitely an a possibility to improve productivity the other part is collaboration we use AI throughout our workplace to collaborate we are dis dispersed we're across the region i run a region of nine countries we're using AI all the time in terms of collaborating and it's transformed how we do marketing i mean this slide deck how it came together we're taking advantage of AI so there's immense advantages in AI but remember visibility confidence trust now why do I say this so for example we have seen since 2024 and remember what I said we're collecting telemetry and information on the threat landscape we are seeing these threats in real time we have seen an 890% increase in Genai traffic and these organizations have limited or no visibility of this traffic so imagine you can't see something is happening how do you prevent an accident difficult right we have also seen unapproved gen AI apps being used again I think this is personally understated and because of this we're seeing many many new attack types attack vectors we've never seen before totally new highly sophisticated fast scalable hard to detect that's what we're dealing with now some simple things is what people don't realize when you use J gen Gen AI to ask a question you're uploading data okay I mean it's it's a this is how you take advantage of genai but unknowingly what typically happens you are uploading confidential IP from your company once it's uploaded where do you think it goes anywhere right and can you bring it back down no okay so this is often over overlooked so your employees may be doing things not even knowing that they're uploading confidential information to Genai to ask a query and this is kind of scary and this is happening believe me so you know typical example data uploads to apps like this it happens all the time the other one is when you're using Gen AI you may be plugging into unauthorized um apps or applications that it's giving data access so again unknowingly through a plug-in you're allowing a third party to access part of your environment your data your IP etc in order to run that particular AI model etc again unknowingly very very common now remember what I said my role here is not to scare people or prevent AI our role here is to provide the guard rails to ensure you have the visibility the confidence and the trust we want people to adopt and use AI in a manner that's safe when cars were first created they didn't have seat belts okay it was an option you want a seat belt it was an option to add to the car you buy a car now the seat belt is not an option it's a must likewise we want to make sure AI is adopted and used in a way that is safe which means do you understand what applications your employees are using do you actually know typically the answer is I think I know or I definitely know but the reality is not the case by knowing what applications are being used you then can understand from a visibility standpoint where you could be attacked you can stop the sensitive data being shared or inadvertently being uploaded and lastly you want to secure this data in a safe place so it may not be compromised and you know what we call this approach is AI access security so remember I talked about data protection you want visibility and you want to ensure you understand the attack service do you understand the points of compromise most organizations as you launch AI applications don't even know where they could be compromised because it's something completely new okay so remember what I talked about greater visibility policies to ensure that the right framework is in place that what is on the sanction list that can be used what cannot be used you're protecting the data all the time and you're using a platform i'll talk about a platform shortly why this is important but a platform approach what I mean is everything is integrated is also very important because if it's not integrated hackers will take advantage of poor integrations or blind spots now this behind me sorry is a typical schematic of uh app architecture when AI agents are used in your organization what is happening now is organizations where launching AI applications are introducing many many new things that previously did not exist so you'll have your web your apps your data your large language models infrastructure etc fairly standard what most people don't realize and this is seen from our research dealing with customers these are the points of compromise if you may note it was quite funny we were sharing the slide deck yesterday with the event organizer they said \"Is there a mistake with this slide?\" Actually there's not a mistake with this slide every point is a potential threat so you have a look i could randomly pick you know for the infrastructure you could be compromised access control in the large language models you know you could be compromised prompt inject you know in the memory in the action in the data in the web these are all areas that are new points of compromise that most organizations are absolutely unaware of and this is real we deal with customers that are dealing with this currently now and they were not even aware so again to the vent organizers no this is not a mistake this is actually the threat landscape now and this is what's happening so our goal here is to know where all of your AI assets are what AI AI products are being used in your environment to protect the apps and the models and secure the data these are the three things that we focus on all the time these three core tenants and this is what's happened in the market ai products have been launched at a rapid pace you saw the 1 billion within two years and the security vendors have responded with lots of point solutions a point solution to handle large language models a point solution to handle uh data a point solution to uh handle you know model scanning etc and that's been the typical approach any security problem in the world be it may the network be it may your mobile device be it may your laptop etc the problem with point solutions is how well are they integrated there are always blind spots and hackers find these blind spots so this is the problem with point solutions but point solutions exist because they're a rapid response to fix a problem the last time there was a rapid response in the market was remember during COVID we all went online with digitization suddenly all of us were buying services online point products handled the potential point of compromise same thing with AI point solutions and the problem with these point solutions they have many many gaps which speaks to the point we look at this holistically okay so we call it Prisma we want everything at a single point to understand what's the agent security what's the model scanning what's the large language models how's the data being handled all in a single place because these are related points if you don't understand this the hacker will take advantage of this and this is what happens and you know at the end of the day remember I talked about visibility you want to know where your AI products are you have to know what's being used if you do not know what your employees are using if you don't know what your children are using how do you protect them difficult right you want to protect against all of the risks you want to protect the data the crown jewels of your company ai is fundamentally about data so how the data is being shared and used and that gets compromised and shared with other parties this is a big big problem so we want to protect the data and of course best of class with that I hope you feel less scared of the world of AI i honestly believe we're at a interesting point in history i have never seen something so rapidly being adopted it is changing the world we as we see it today i mean I just walked through the convention center it amazes me the amount of booths here but what I want to highlight we need to do this in a manner that's secure we need to do it in a level of visibility confidence and trust i don't want to stop AI AI but I want to make sure we do it in a safe manner and with that being said thank you very much have a wonderful conference thank you",
