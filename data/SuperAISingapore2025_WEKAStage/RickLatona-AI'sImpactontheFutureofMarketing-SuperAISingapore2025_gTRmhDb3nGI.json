marketing product that I thought uh I wasn't really sure what kind of audience would even be at this show so that so this is a product that we think is good for everybody and and I'm going to have a open honest conversation with you and tell you about some of the challenges we're dealing with and and about the experience that we had building this product and well here we go but just a little bit about me first why I think I'm qualified to be doing this um I've been in the internet business since there was one i registered a million domain names in 93 when I was a kid um you know I've I'm still in the domain business with a with another company of mine we have like 10 million names and we manage another 40 million names i'm a Google partner um I have an M&A company that specializes in selling SAS businesses and e-commerce businesses so I've been in digital marketing my whole life basically um so what we're building what I want to talk about is campaign.ai and I'm trying to build the ultimate tool for myself and for all the different companies I own because I'm a serial entrepreneur and I'm like if if this will be if this will if I can not have a social media team and I can and I can bet 30 minutes a day by myself have the most awesome social media presence across multiple different brands then I know other people would want this product also so I'm just I just threw a bunch of random screenshots up here and I'm just going to kind of talk about them uh so you know this is what the the dashboard will look like and you'll have you know some some basic intelligence but you know what the what the tool actually does is you'll be able to connect each of your social media accounts some of some of them like Twitter are open for personal accounts and business accounts um but if we if we don't have API access we can't do anything so in the case of like Facebook and and some of some of the others like LinkedIn we'll only be able to automate business accounts we won't be able to do personal accounts um but the the kind of the the core idea is that the best way to grow your social media following and to market your business is to interact with other accounts you know like replying to somebody else's thread so in this screenshot you know what I'm doing in the screenshot is is uploading a list of target accounts so you can identify like for example 10,000x accounts that you uh want to do business with or that you or like 20 accounts that you think are competitors or just people that you just want to engage with or industry leaders or or whatever so you create these different groups of accounts or you can have the AI help you you find those groups of accounts there's many different ways to kind of build these lists and what the agent's going to do what you can I'll show you all the different ways you can configure in the coming slides but what the agent will do will automatically respond to other people's posts and your brand's tone of voice or if you want to be a human in the loop uh you can configure it to send a message to a WhatsApp or a Telegram group especially if you have people all around the world in different time zones um to where they can approve or deny or suggest changes before the post actually go out and it's really powerful stuff and and and for those those target accounts that you call competitors the agent will send you however frequently you want it once an hour once a day or once a week you know you know telling you what your competitors are doing on social media or or instant alerts if they launch products and services and all kinds of intelligence like that um and you know but the the core of it is is that it learns so when it suggests a post or reply or an engagement or whatever it does you can you can tell it what you liked and what you didn't like how you would have done it um and things like that and you know but here's where it gets interesting so for each brand that you're managing you can you know upload your logo uh you say what your mission statement is or if it's your personal account what your personal bio is and your main values you can link to FAQs or blog post or articles that have been written about you um connected to GitHub repository if I had scrolled down further you would have seen where I could al also attach documents like white papers and things like that and basically educate the AI on everything that it needs to know about the brand that it's going to be automatically marketing for you uh you can set the personality and voice if you want to be professional friendly casual witty you know all those types of things um you know do you want to be reactive balanced highly proactive avoid humor you know oh sorry I went too far i think I went too far yeah there you go um you know how often you want it to you you fine tune how it interacts with you know if it should use emojis and things like that and if it should be short and snappy medium detailed um the frequency should do things we got all kinds of stuff on here i mean you can um this is this is awesome because you can prohibit topics you know don't talk about these things but you know these are things that we really do want you to talk about you know try to be original or use curated things you know do you want it to be creative or do you want it to be conservative um what your target audience might be uh posting behavior do you want it to how often do you want to post um you know do you want to do educational promotional you know those types of things uh engagement strategy do you want to to do active follow-ups or conversation starters do you want it to respond right away within an hour do you want it to wait a day or do you want to respond immediately um and then you know you know some people are you because the tool has you can create posts and there's all kinds of AI tools to help you really make it perfect the perfect post for each of the social platforms so again I just kind of threw a bunch of screenshots up here so I'm going to kind of go off book for a minute um so like when you use the create post tool you you basically just say what you want to say you upload whatever images you want you upload whatever videos you want and then it kind of customizes those for each of the platforms like it might say it a different way on Tik Tok than it says it on X versus the way uh it handles on YouTube of videos and stuff like that and um so some people might just want to use the that assisted post feature and and not have it trying to learn and stuff like that but so it's optional um you know this is like you know just avoid risk at all costs or be aggressive and take bold steps um and uh then of course compliance and rules just don't do any of these things don't get my brand in trouble um and one of the things we realized while we were building this is you know if this is a hit and we end up with thousands or tens of thousands of users hopefully or more uh then we have we have a marketplace so so someone who wants to pay someone to promote something on social media can create an offer and find people who connect to and make the offers and if you have your social media accounts connected and you're a customer you could literally go to um the monetize section of the site and see offers and all you have to do is click that little green accept and schedule button and the money gets credited to your account and you basically send out that promoted um tweet or whatever it is and of course you can opt out of that you can you don't have you can opt out of letting other advertisers on the platform uh see you and follow you let's see i'm doing pretty good on time um and you know we've built this we've built this tool for media agencies um you know where they can manage tons and tons and tons of accounts um you know like and we're trying to make it affordable and I'm not even trying to sign anybody up right now we're probably going to let you use it for free at first anybody who's But I'm just trying to show you like what our business logic is and how we're thinking about the pricing because I would be this guy you know I have like I have like five companies that I would want to use this tool for and to me paying $400 a month um to where I can with a mobile app control it for 30 minutes a day and have like a really broad social presence for all every one of my brands is would be just incredible uh okay so how can you get involved well I said right now if you go to campaign.ai there's not even a place to sign up to to to know when it launches um but we do have a booth right around the corner it says Chad AAI WOW on it and there's a few different brands on it it's literally the first booth around that corner my guys could get your information and and let you know when when we're going to launch if you have an interest in this tool um but if you want to profit off of what we're doing I'm going to have to get a little web 3 nerdy on you guys because we are also a web 3 company um and you know it's I'm just going to try to breeze through this part because I know this isn't a web 3 convention but we are we are selling nodes so these nodes are going to um basically host all the AI agents the website pretty much everything we're going to have 50,000 nodes that this campaign.ai tool plus many other tools that we're building are all going to run on this network of nodes and the the owners of these node licenses who pay $ 20 $30 a month to AWS or whoever to host these nodes will receive daily emissions and the WOW token that we're going to be launching in a couple months so if you have any interest in that my guys can also help you try to understand what's going on there i mean but the reason that we're doing it the reason we have these nodes is because you know we're we're essentially outsourcing a lot of our expenses to to run the business to the Nord operators and then rewarding them in the token and then and then we'll be sending the actual revenue um uh a large portion of the revenue will be going to a token vault again it's it's a little a little advanced for anybody who's not a crypto person but you know a large portion of the wild tokens are going to be in a in a vault and and percentage of the revenue will go into that same vault so the the logic is if there's 10 WOW tokens in that vault on$1 then a WOW token would be redeemable for 10 cents if there were 10 WOW tokens and $10 a WOW token would be redeemable for a dollar so the more profits get funneled into that vault the more it kind of supports the base token price so that's that's what's going to be happening in the background but for but if you're a web two company that's just interested in marketing tools they won't know any of this is happening they don't know need to know any thing that's happening because one of my core beliefs in life is that trying to onboard a billion users to web 3 is a fool's errand lots of people have tried to do it over the last 10 plus years everybody has failed so why not try to onboard a billion people's money to web 3 and then leverage web 3's economics to have a competitive advantage so I mean that's really what we're doing here like because because if if our products like campaign.ai AI are successful and it drives revenue token goes up we sell a lot of nodes that C if another company had the same product my what I what I make off that customer is more than what my competitor makes off this customer with this business model therefore I can outspend them to acquire that customer so that that's what's going on there uh and it's all this it's all this cycle because we're we're going to be spending money um from all the node sales to just you know keep building products uh and we're actually going to acquire SAS companies and put them on the network of nodes uh so again I'm not here trying to sell you anything i'm just going to even skip past that so it doesn't look like I am uh you can just go to our booth if you want more information on when campaign's going to launch or if you have any interest at all in the whole node thing but I'm Rick at wow.ai i'm Rick Leona on every social media platform just rick latona so if anybody ever just wants to reach out to me ask questions connect for whatever reason my door is wide open and thank you for listening to me",
