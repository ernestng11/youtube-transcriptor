    "aggregated_text": "so my name is uh Terren Quac I'm the uh founder of humanity protocol Uh it's really interesting for me to be in an AI conference because what we are doing is more crypto and blockchain than AI Uh but I I think in terms of the problem that we're trying to solve there's quite a lot of relevance Um because I think the way we think about what humanity protocol is doing it's actually solving some of the dangers that uh AI actually causes You know I think there there's a lot of good things that's coming out of AI Uh but there are also a lot of problems So the humanity protocol is a is a blockchain and uh what we're focused on is uh is is identity and unlike any other blockchain that exists we natively have integrated what we call verifiable credentials into humanity protocol and the idea for us is to allow people to be able to prove things and the reason why we think it's important very soon for people to be able to prove things is because AI is making it harder and harder for us to trust uh anything that's going on in the internet world right when we look at sort of when we look at any sort of website that we're going to on a day-to-day basis you're solving captures you know trying to prove that you're a human being doing math formulas picking out traffic lights you know when when we when we look at the internet when we look at the internet over 50% you know almost 50% of internet traffic I think this was 2023 by last year I think it was 51 or 52% of all internet traffic is already coming from bots right and then you add in AI agents you add in all the uh the ability for people to essentially replicate data uh very very quickly with AI Uh we actually think it's becoming super important for us to be able to verify things Um and so what we've decided to create is uh something called proof of humanity And with proof of humanity the whole idea for us is to prove allow people to prove various attributes about themselves And we're starting with probably one of the most important attributes which is whether you're a human being or not Right so we're starting with that But then the idea for us is to also allow people to prove other things Whether it's maybe it's your education maybe it's your employment maybe uh you know maybe it's your loyalty status in in in in in an airline uh your your nationality whether you're sanctioned etc etc Historically I think it's not been that important for people to prove these things because number one uh there's not really too many benefits to uh to falsifying these things And then the cost of actually uh faking it is is pretty high Uh right now what we're seeing with with AI as you can imagine with uh with deep fake with chat GPT with LLMs etc etc the cost of actually doing this is becoming lower and lower Right if we look at for example recently the uh the conflict between Iran and Israel um we see videos of uh videos of the attacks uh being popping up on uh on Twitter And it's really interesting because right now every single uh Twitter video that we see the very first few comments is always somebody asking if this is real You know historically that would never be the case you know like if you look at sort of these these sort of videos it's either it's either real or it's probably from a Tom Cruz movie But what we're seeing now is you know whether it's with Google Veo or any sort of AI models the cost of actually generating fake content the cost of pretending to be somebody else uh is becoming very very cheap right and so what we decided to create is uh is humanity protocol Um and uh the idea for us is that we're creating a unique identifier for every human being in the world Uh the 5 million number is a little bit outdated because right now we're we're hitting we just hit around 9 million people at this point Um raised a little bit of money from from V VC funds in in the crypto space and the whole idea is to build an infrastructure layer not just for web 3 or the blockchain world but actually for the internet or even in real life right the the the whole goal for us is to be able to allow people to prove any single thing Um you know we're leveraging technologies as a sort of cryptosp speak uh where we can allow people to prove their writer rating prove their loyalty tier prove their developer contributions etc etc And we actually think this is really uh really important um because if you think about sort of some of the biggest tech companies right now uh there's a big focus on building AI uh I think you know apart from open AAI which is uh which is doing that as an independent company you have Google and you have Facebook or Meta that are also very focused on building their own models and if you think about the fact that companies like Apple or Amazon actually are not that focused on building AI uh there's there's one reason we think uh as to why that's the case it's it's very much tied to the fact that if you look at Google and Meta these are traditionally advertising businesses where they generate the bulk of their hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues from advertising and we actually think when it comes to you know this age of AI uh advertising is going to change very substantially number one because what I said earlier in terms of content production in terms of publishing uh a lot of stuff is going to be AI generated uh you're going to have social media you're going to have Twitter etc etc flooded with bots and then on the consumption side what we're also seeing is just a lot of bot traffic AI agents commenting with each other etc etc It's really becoming harder and harder to tell what is actually real what is somebody that is what is a human being who's a potential consumer versus you know AI agents just commenting on each other's threads And so you know from our perspective what we're actually trying to do by proving first that somebody's a human being in the digital world and then moving on to allow people to prove various things is actually potentially creating what we call the biggest identity graph right when we look at sort of Google historically advertising is all about advertising is all about you know intent You know I'm telling Google I want to search for this I want to buy a car I'm looking for a Japanese restaurant etc etc That's how Google is able to serve me uh you know relevant advertising and they're able to generate revenues If we look at the next step of that which was Meta and Facebook it's all about the social graph right the social graph allowed Meta to know oh you you you claim that you went to this school You claim that you're friends with this guy You claim that you're you know 25 years old and working at this job And that provided Facebook with the ability to also you know create targeted advertising Similarly on the LinkedIn side right we actually think moving forward it's becoming easier and easier for any of these things to be fake And it already is right you know for me to be for me to pretend to be somebody else all I really need to do is create a new email create a new Facebook account use AI to generate a bunch of content on Instagram so that I can be be somebody and then create also a LinkedIn profile and it it it can all be fake right and so what we're actually trying to do with humanity protocol is number one verify that you're a human being and then leverage what we call trusted identity validators um to prove that you you know to verify various things and then leverage ZKTLS to also allow you to create data enrichment right it might be the case that I can prove that I am an a avid gamer and I spend 20 hours a week on on on on on Steam or you know I'm a I'm a frequent traveler because you know I have X status on on Marriott or whatnot And this actually creates a big ecosystem where users now get to actually choose what data they actually want to share and potentially monetize from that Um this is technical stuff It's it's not that interesting Uh but yeah Um yeah So I I I think you know a little bit different from sort of how the whole web two or or traditional internet world works is that for humanity protocol the whole idea for us and what we've built into our blockchain and our core platform is that ultimately people get to control uh all the data uh about them They get to share uh they get to share whenever they want and to whoever they want right and they can also revoke access um if they choose to not want to share that piece of information And I think moving forward this is going to be super important because you know we're already seeing cases where people are pretending to be other people Um you know we're seeing cases where there there are scams there or frauds you know deep fake videos And you know where I'm from Hong Kong I think it was just a year ago there was a big company there was an international company where somebody got scammed for 25 million bucks because you know they got pretend because the the guy the finance director's employers the CEO CFO COO all you know had deep fake videos created of them and then in a Zoom meeting essentially approved a payment right so what we're trying to do here is solve this problem and I think it's it's really interesting because I think a year ago a year and a half two years ago when we started working on this um most of the investors that we were pitching didn't really understand the need for this um and then over the last two years as we started building this we got more and more interest from everybody whether it's the crypto community or whether it's investors simply because right now if you go on Instagram you go on Tik Tok you see videos that you cannot differentiate from real or fake And you know going on any sort of website you're looking at content where you don't know whether it's written by a human being or not You go to a LinkedIn profile see a picture you don't know if that's a real person or not And so we actually think over time in the coming months years there's going to be a bigger and bigger need for uh for what we're doing Yeah So and just to uh just to close up with some of the use cases that we uh we think humanity protocol enables as I mentioned you know would be really interesting I don't I I think you know AI generated content is great Uh AI agents are great bots are great Um I think the very key thing for us is not necessarily to say filter out AI agents or bots but at least give people or consumers the ability to differentiate right it would be really interesting if we could say you know what if Twitter or if you know whether it's Tik Tok or you know on Facebook at the very least I could say you know what this content is generated by a human being or this account is controlled by a human being rather than just a chachi bt rapper right and then the other thing is also looking at something like LinkedIn right it would be really interesting if we could say you know what if this guy claims to work for Google he really does work for Google or if this guy claims that he's working for you know um if this guy claims that he went to Harvard you know there's actually a verifiable credential tied to Harvard for uh for this individual right so that that's sort of the uh the world that we envision will be needed over the coming you know probably in the coming months it's already going to be uh super important Um and then on the crypto side you know we we there's a thing called airdrops where people give out free tokens and free money And so the whole idea of civil resistance and making sure that you know it's not going to farmers who are creating unlimited number of accounts is a pretty big problem for uh for the crypto world because it's it's tens of billions of dollars that are being distribute distributed on an annual basis uh other sort of things right you know online one person one vote um looking at reputation building as I mentioned you know being able to consolidate all my accounts from travel on cafe on Chris flyer on Marriott etc etc for data enrichment you know these are all the things that we uh we're trying to do with uh with humanity protocol um and I think as I mentioned you know it's it's it's probably looking at uh s solving a problem where a lot of people don't realize uh is going to be coming to us very very soon uh largely because of you know the crazy impressive technology that AI is bringing to the world Um yeah so I mean it's it's crypto so uh you know I'm I'm this is not financial advice but uh you know the the whole idea for us is uh humanity protocol is powered by uh it's powered by a token um it's not launched yet but uh what we're trying to do is allow for there to be value accretion for uh for this infrastructure right the idea is that we are allowing people to verify things about themselves and then allowing we're creating an open API platform and SDKs so that different sort of applications different sort of enterprises will be able to make use of our our technology to verify things So we we certainly imagine a world where down the road maybe there's a dating app a Tinder or whatever where you know it's only real people or where you know if somebody claims to work somewhere or go to school somewhere it's actually verified right or a LinkedIn or Facebook or different sort of programs and projects and platforms and we have a bunch of them already building on top of humanity So um you know the uh the token is not live yet So if you search for it and you see something like this it's it's fake Um but definitely look out for it Um and then yeah so you know for for humanity protocol in blockchain speak we have something called testnet Um so you know we the whole product for for roughly our 9 million users are currently on testnet Uh we're going to be migrating to mainet very very soon Um if you want to go check it out uh scan the QR code It's really cool Um because what I mentioned earlier is that we have verifiable credentials and one of the key things that we're doing is sort of leveraging biometrics also to help for proof of personhood and verifying that you're a human being Um so that's my time for today Thanks a lot",
