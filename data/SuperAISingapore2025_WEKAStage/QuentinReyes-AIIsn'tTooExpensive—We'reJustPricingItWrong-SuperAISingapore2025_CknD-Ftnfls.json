    "aggregated_text": "hi everybody i'm the CEO of Hyperfusion we are the largest GPU cloud in the UAE so I'm going to talk about something that is a bit the ugly truth in our industry that nobody wants to talk about which is pricing and why nobody talks about it because first of all it's super boring and the second problem that we have is that nobody really understands how it works imagine AI computing the best analogy I can use is that you go in a coffee shop and I'm going to charge you 10 cents per second for you to get the coffee done but me as a consumer I do not care if you use an espresso machine or if you use a super fancy or cheap one i just want to know how much my coffee will but nobody in AI can tell you how much your task will cost so you're going to have the people who are the most honest actually relatively speaking which is the hour basing but that's also doesn't really make sense because you're not sure about the outcome and then you have the token pricing model but nobody really knows how many token you need actually not even the people who sell you the tokens know how much you need and how much you used it's roughly estimations because the billing is extremely complicated this leds to massive frictions actually most of the startups that are working around they struggle on their pricing and then they goes back to the investors how do I price in the quality of that product on the market and this is leds to a whole less of domino effect that challenge that today nearly 70% of the growth capital that startups raise just goes into computing and AI related computing costs so we're in a situation where I have a product I don't know how much going to cost but still if I want to lock in the time actually limit the bleeding I don't even know if this is my product is going to actually going to deliver and we see like from the hyperscalers they add some hidden fees then you're going to have storage and networking and stuff and I'm sure all of you have heard these horror stories with the machine learning engineer forgot to shut off the GPU cluster on AWS to Google and then they would come back on Monday and they just realized that they owe 20,000 $30,000 to Google there is an alternative to this model and there has been percentage before basically the cost needs to change we need to know before we start how much going to cost we need to move from a time to value today it's a bit like if you were in a taxi but you have no guarantee of arriving but still a taxi meter goes and on and on and on where it's very easy actually to have a predictive model to understand how much this task going to cost you and how much repetitiveness of this task is also going to cost you but everybody's lazy in this industry and every single day you have new marketplaces of GPUs about an hour and a race to the bottom to an hour about how little do we cost but frankly doesn't solve the fundamental problem how much it's going to cost me to perform my task and this is the main friction of where a lot of startups will going to fund raise because they don't know and we need to understand for one minute the genesis of this basically in AI we have machine learning and AI engineers there are the pilots and then you're going to have the software developers they're the ones who put the fuel in the plane and the hardware engineers who build the plane and all of these guys speak a different language and none of them understands each other so we've put in the situation where the machine learning engineer needs to choose which hardware he needs but that's not his world his world is about how the mattress and the compilers work he doesn't know which GPU he needs so then he's going to talk to his software developer who doesn't know as well and then if the hardware engineer doesn't know how AI works so basically it's a triangle of hell we basically decided to take a different approach we realized like wait it's actually better for everybody if we better understand what are you trying to do you know in my region in the GCC people tend to think that we have a lot of money i'm sure you've seen all the news of Trump and all these billions of dollars but actually people are very cautious of how they spend the money and when people come to me they say \"Hi I'd like 400 GPUs for 6 months.\" The first thing we say is \"No you don't how about you start explaining what are you trying to do?\" And by asking this question what are you trying to do usually the actual needs in the assessment is 70% to 80% less than what they thought why for two reasons first of all nobody really knows how computing at scale works it's a very complicated topic related to how a silicon moves electrons to how storage is done how the CUDA compilers etc i'm not going to go into all the boring details but you can imagine how complicated it is and second is because it's repetitive tasks what I mean here is that 90% of the people usually need compute for the same single need so they think what they're doing is unique but for 90 case of scenario they just take an open source model and they just want to run it and fine-tune it a bit and actually if you work with these entrepreneurs you can dramatically reduce the cost so in the present industry we saw that you know we're going to change the pricing model there were these platform like Zapier typically it's not really AI that's true but based on outcome and that's really what we think is the future in AI computing pricing which is outcomebased uh pricing solutions so how does this happen well the irony is that you need AI to be able to do that so you need an AI to price an AI yeah I know it sounds a bit like a circle of hair as well but basically the AI will understand because it can compile what have you done with how the workloads of hundreds of thousands of engineers have done and the beauty of this is do you know the great thing of engineers they love to complain even if it's great they'll never say it's great but if this 1% wrong trust me they will go on every single forum and complain about it which makes us an insane amount of publicly available data for us to train a model saying like wait if they're trying to achieve this task that's the number one pain they face and the pains are always related to latency cost bad choice etc etc etc so that's where we stand and we think this is the model that the industry should adopt which is hey how about we start understanding how AI works how can we have a better pricing how can we move in a better way because ultimately it's a better ROI for everybody you will see in the spectrum in the next year or two this massive bubble of GPU marketplaces completely collapse because it's a race to the bottom it's a commodities price today everybody here can buy a GPU put it for two bucks but you're not delivering any service to the startup you're not helping them scale you're not helping them deliver an increased value proposition the only thing you're doing is the quick buck and now today Nvidia of course they're in the in the job of selling more and more of these computing chips and they're just adding fuel to the fire where we think that we should actually start to understand models help eneic platforms help projects to move forward and uh ultimately deliver and getting better computing pricing today we saw that nobody has really priced in computing and AI yet nobody really realized like who's gonna pay so one side you have free VC money coming in that's great or you have hyperscalers that sponsor that's great as well but we think this is not sustainable and if the whole cloud providers and the enterprise don't change their product model pretty soon then this will really end pretty badly so that was my perspective from how we see computing uh in the Middle East but thank you thank you for your time",
