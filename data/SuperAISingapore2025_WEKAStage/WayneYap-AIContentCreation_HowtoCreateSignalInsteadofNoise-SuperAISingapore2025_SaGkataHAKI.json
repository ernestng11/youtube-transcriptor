videos where it goes I crack the code to viral expose using AI most people don't know about this yet and then you go to the X it says like nine views as well like I'm wondering if this is what they meant when they said most people don't know about this anyway I've got bad news for you one year ago I posted my first thread on X it goes I 152X a company I acquired in 31 months from 2.5K MR to 380KMR here are the five things that gave us the most results i thought this was like a pretty good post and I put in a lot of effort into this and then it got 69 views um just zooming a little bit bigger i I found it quite funny it's like a cosmic trick so welcome to my keynote anyway I was just like early here if you look at the bottom left of the screen um I started my ex journey posting content around June last year and I had my first viral post around July and then I kind of took a break and then I started I got more viral post and then I got some more viral posts and um I just show you some examples of the viral posts first so you know that um like I I'm not one of those guys with like nine views it goes I'm 34 seven years ago I won millions as Singapore's number one poker player and then I talk about some my next post is Naval Ravikhan once said \"Mitate 60 minutes for 60 days.\" So I did essentially this few post right the ones that went really viral like the first post on the left um took my account from about 400 followers to 1.5K and then my second viral post took my account from 2.5K to like 8K and then I had a few other pretty variable posts and then one more oh um this one got 18.3 million and this essentially took my account from like 14K followers to 27K followers and I'm sharing all of this with you because if you ask me like one year ago I probably wouldn't have believed that it is like you can actually grow an audience using a heavily AI powered strategy i mean it's not like the AI will get you to the finished product but you can use AI in a lot of parts of it to help you to improve your the quality of your output as well as the speed of your output so in this presentation I'm going to share with you a little bit about my like how I do it okay so enough about me just wanted to quickly get a show of hands like so I can tune the presentation a little bit how many of you actually create content with today content creators any marketers in the room founders um your boss sent you here all right um oops so the truth is that the internet now looks like this there's so much noise that you can barely see the signal and I think the reason is that the world is moving towards high volume low quality like you know that 10,00 viral videos 10,000 videos with one click like what's the point if you create a whole ton of high volume content but it's low quality i think the way to win is if you um if you go to the top left here instead you try and like put in the resources into getting high quality low volume and because once you can actually get to high quality low volume essentially it is more about deploying more agents deploying more resources deploying more people to get that content you can scale it to high volume high quality so maybe some of you are wondering like but how well I'm going to very quickly give some practical tips in the next 10 minutes so um okay another question how many of you think that today you are creating highquality content with AI today anyone like you nice and how many of you think that it's possible to create high quality content of AI today um cool and okay maybe not right now but you do you think that in the next 3 or 6 months it's possible to create high quality content of AI okay there's a lot of people without a hands up i feel like you're at the wrong conference this is super AI you all should go to like lousy AI yeah so if we talk about what are the building blocks for viral content I'll break it down into three big categories the first is research the second is personalization and the third is distribution so I'm going to cover the bottom five like the idea knowledge format and I'm going to go to personalization the story and the style and I'm not really going to talk so much about distribution but essentially what distribution is is when you have a good piece of content you can just put more money into getting it distributed more you can buy collabs you can buy people to repost for you you can buy ads you can create you can buy like 100 iPads like they do in China and then like scale many accounts distribution is another complete thing and I'm not going to talk about that today so yeah so here are the five tips on how you can actually create high quality content with AI today um if you want to make good content it always starts with the idea first and the idea essentially in my opinion has like two main parts for what makes a piece of content like it gives it the potential to go viral number one is that there must be some commonality between a lot of the there must be some common factor that everybody knows so like it's a famous figure for example in my threads earlier it was Nova Ravikhan and it was China and then there must be a unique point of view so I talked about my out-of- body experiences in the Nava one and then for the China one I talk about how Singapore is advanced but if you like when I went to China I saw like even crazier more advanced stuff so if you have the idea then it makes a lot of things easier so how do you get good ideas the old way is you scroll through your social media you try to find good videos you visit the profiles and then you try not to get distracted and then you get high quality like you try and replicate some of their best content the new way is you can use AI to like do this whole stretch of things all at one go um and I just show you like very quickly some of the workflows that I use you don't have to like like look into all of the details of all of the steps because I know it's a lot and I can't cover every step essentially like uh a workflow like this will allow me to take a whole list of creators and then just take one by one um find put it into a list of like I can take one creator and I can find 100 other similar creators and put them into a list then after I get them into a list I can put them through another workflow which then loops them one by one and for example this one on the screen it is strip 20 video creators uh 20 videos per creator so essentially you would then take all of these videos you would use another agent to score based on virality and then you put it into another spreadsheet if you look at this like orange line section here it has this virality score and essentially it's the formula is like I use views plus a multiple of the likes comments and shares and then I divide by the following count to the power of 0.9 so that um I give like smaller creators an equal shot because like Instagram is like uh it doesn't always prioritize small creators so I want to give small creators who get outside views view count a shot to show in my ranking system and then essentially I can just like take the the URL I can put it into another AI to just like go and find the main topic go and research that topic more and then I can create a content with that so the middle portion of this is the knowledge or like the re deep research part and because if you want to create good content after you have the idea you also want to have like the facts the juicy pieces of information and thankfully right now with AI you can just use like deep research I don't know like anybody use deep research cuz it's like super amazing I use it pretty much every day if you're not using it right now it's like quite a waste you can use like Gemini D chubby plot the There are free China ones like Cuban and um deepseek they are pretty good as well so this is like easy way to do the research a more advanced way will be to put it into a workflow automation so essentially I have this like three-step process where I'm do the planning of the topic the research and then writing the content so if I zoom into the left hand side you can see that earlier I mentioned I'm trying to find a unique piece of content that has a popular thing that somebody knows that everybody knows and a unique point of view if the content is too generic then I would so essentially I'm feeding this uh like filling up the form with some word or series of words if it's too generic then it will go to an agent to find topics that could potentially um that has those two elements and then find three versions of it and then another agent would then decide on the topic so after you decide on the topic then you go to a topic planner you plan like five different things to research and then you would go and script the web and do all that that that that stuff there and then compile it and then for this instance I am putting into my typhully because the main channel I'm drawing on is X yeah but essentially you can use this for LinkedIn you can use this for Instagram as well just so that you get higher quality pieces of content and then there's the format so what's the format the format is like how do you write in a way that other people can understand there's the hook there's the context there's an open loop the format I typically use is like shocking statement uh and then build on it and then do a twist like but there's something even more shocking and that works quite well so one easy way to to crack the code of format is to borrow from other people who are already winning with the post so essentially like in this example I'm taking some winning post that I see on X i'm just put it into a spreadsheet and then I would fit the spreadsheet to uh custom GPT this is OpenAI's assistant on the back end because GPT 4.5 is my favorite um yeah and then if you want to do it in a more advanced way you would take the thread hook then you would uh you would use one agent just for the front part of the hook and then another agent to write the whole thing and then another one to check the format so checking of the format would be like removing the things you don't like like M dash or the rhetorical questions so um quick break what's the commonality behind between these three posts well it's the story cuz like when like right now when generic pieces of content with AI is so easy to make you kind of want to have a golden thread throughout all of your posts that is your personal story so here's how it would look like for seeding AI with your personal story what I do is I use a term board that uh can detect voice or text and then I would take that chunk of text go and plan out potential topics to write about and then go and research about and then combine it with the initial seat uh text or voice and then create that piece of content so an example would be like my CTO Vish he gave me this chunk of text i just pasted it to the AI then it would output like uh pretty high quality content it give it back to me on Telegram for checking as well as I put it into threads just the text uh without the images and stuff so I know there's a lot of words and um I think if anybody's interested I made it I made like a free version that y'all can try on my diagram you can scan this QR code i set a restriction such that it's a minimum 50 words and you can just take out your phone voice message the telegram bot because I I don't want I don't want my agent to write a full thread if you just say hello to it so essentially that that's why I put a minimum and you want if you give it enough context you'll be able to write in a a better way that is not so generic yeah uh and I made it one per person cuz it's so a bit expensive like I use the best models like GBD 4.5 is quite expensive um yeah so then last one style i'll go through this quickly um essentially if you want to write content in your own language and style the easiest way is just to have a tone style guide which I like essentially it's a long prompt and then you take this long prompt you paste in a chunk of your text your own words like maybe your blog articles or whatever and then it comes out with a guide that emulates the way you speak so for example there's like certain jargon that I like to use certain uh formatting that I like to use to make my ads threads go viral and yeah it just copies it you can also take ex like existing content that has already gone viral and then merge it put it put that that that uh first style guide plus the second one into a vector store and like GBD 4.5 cuz it mimics the style really well like it's much better than plot and like plot 4 opus on it yeah cool i know I went through a lot so just want to check anybody wants slides cool nice so well thankfully we're at AI conference and there's a bot that you can scan to get the I don't know i'll just get off the way so can scan it cool everyone good all right thanks and um yeah if you have any questions I'll go into the phone on WhatsApp as well so just ask ask me on the WhatsApp over there yeah thanks",
