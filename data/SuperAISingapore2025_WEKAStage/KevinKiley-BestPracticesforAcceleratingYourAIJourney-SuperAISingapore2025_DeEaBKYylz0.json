    "aggregated_text": "good morning uh pleasure to be here with you today from the United States uh and very excited to talk about a problem that I think many of your organizations are beginning to experience as we see organizations embrace AI and the capacity and the potential for it we will see more and more sprawl and with that challenges for managing it on the screen behind me i wanted to illustrate this by talking through a sample example journey most of your organizations may have started building a simple chatbot uh that was the first foray into it the success of that internally maybe gave you the confidence to go deploy it externally you moved to some sort of web chat uh with your customers or your employees that was available externally from there you probably tried some other products if you're a Microsoft shop you got Copilot you may have done a little trial and experimentation with that there it expands out with more customized approach maybe you're bringing in an agency maybe one of your firms is helping companies do this from there we can continue to see it grow that success gets other success we embed the AI usage across other products and tech your vendors are now bringing in other AI solutions we just heard about a couple of there and more chat bots are proliferating from there we expand into initial orchestration where you're having some of these different agents different AI capabilities talk to each other and you see that this picture is starting to get a little more complicated as we expand out and move into other areas i'm seeing a lot of nodding heads and photos being taken so I think this is uh not uncommon you may then start seeing these point solutions and the gentleman from Palo Alto talked about this uh proliferation of all these different products that are coming in your employees your business users they want these chat bots they want these different agents they want these different capabilities and you've got more and more happening across the organization this itself brings in more ideas and now you start seeing other chat bots other capabilities being deployed across the business and you're now embedding these into the way that your users are working this is where you'll start to really need some level of orchestration today's topic and where I hope to get to by the end of this is a picture where you see the ability to orchestrate all of this together to manage it to make it sustainable across the organization now look this is at a time where things are evolving very quickly we've all seen just how fast some of these models are moving what was best last month is been eclipsed by something new this month and this trend is just going to continue to accelerate the technology is getting faster and faster and more capable for your organizations as this happens it opens up immense potential and so much capacity for you to do new things that will really move the needle in your business but only if you can embrace them getting to the latest and greatest will become a strategic imperative for the company that you have to do as almost a existential threat it's not enough to use yesterday's technology when things are moving this quickly you've got to have a way to dynamically move to the latest and greatest that model that's the best for you and if it wasn't enough to drive that your vendors are going to push you off of their old model you've got to stay fluid you've got to be dynamic and able to move to that latest and greatest because they're going to probably deprecate the model we've seen this happening already it's happened in months sometimes in weeks that a new model is released and then you're pushed off of it to go to the latest beyond that there are financial differences if I had started last year with OpenAI's GP01 preview I was paying $60 per million per million output tokens fast forward through the subsequent releases all the way down to GBT4.1 Nano which has very similar performance characteristics and it's 40 cents per million output tokens now if you had built that application or that process and you were really locked into using that earlier model you were way overpaying for the capabilities that you could have been using so again important financial reasons why you'll need to be able to move quickly between these models on top of that we're now seeing the dependence on these models becoming a risk for the business last week if you noticed the chat GPT OpenAI was down for about 10 hours right in the middle of the Western Working Day this was a massive outage for those companies that had deep solutions built on their products because they just weren't performing they were offline many companies will see this across this year continue to struggle with this this is a business continuity or disaster recovery message again you'll have to be able to move between models you have to be able to do it very quickly on top of that there are all the security concerns i won't belabor these because we talked about them in two sessions ago but new risks of adversarial attacks uh organizations trying to deliberately manipulate your models take advantage of them or even exfiltrate the model itself that model that you've trained with your data is now a risk to the business if someone were to break into it we also see threats from data poisoning and prompt injection attacks and a whole host of new sophisticated attack vectors coming at your AI across the organization so again the need to have some way of measuring and managing what's being done and the security across your AI platform as agents open up new possibility there'll be a lot of new threats here and we're already seeing this agents can be overly permissed they've been given access to all of your data and now someone can go manipulate that agent to take advantage of it we also see a lot of problems or errors because of natural language uh using an agent is not like using an API where it's very deterministic and I'm going to work with it a certain way an agent may interpret what's being said differently and act on it differently and that is subject to manipulation so a lot of developmental risks around the way that agents are going to perform uh how do we counter that there's this whole host of new challenges this avalanche this flood of them coming there are tools out there there are a number of open source tools but many of these have their own problems if you've experimented with some of these you've seen that they have challenges and security risks because again they are open source you you have a whole host of risks and many of these have been again acknowledged in the press just over the last few weeks where we've seen some major exploits with some of the more common open source tools the vendors are releasing new capabilities uh we saw Anthropic come out with MCP and we've talked about that a few times today already mcp gives us a lot of capability to manage the interaction of these tool calls to provide a little more control a lot of benefits that it offers to your organization if you can employ it but it also carries some risks that it's not quite ready with uh we see that there are still risks of tool poisoning and rugpull attacks where I'm changing the level of authority or authentication for that that tool call uh that a bad actor might be able to take advantage of uh whole list of challenges around data leakage and unauthorized tool execution we also see dependency risks if something breaks in there that that tool call could innaral the whole process and bring the agent down and then of course the communication itself not having some of the standards of security and protocols that we would typically employ for handling very sensitive information as these agents work between each other so know that there are real risks with MCP as much as it moves things forward you'll still want some level of management around the way that MCP and those tool calls work beyond that uh the A2A protocol uh that came out just about six weeks ago again a great advancement in the way that these agents will be able to collaborate and communicate with one another but there are still risks with it if you've played with A2A or you've started building with it you've seen that it is effectively a JSON blob that can contain a lot of sensitive information information again that a bad actor might try to use against you knowing what that agent's capable of or what it's looking for what connections it's authorized to make all of that information can be contained there and again without some level of management or security around it you've now introduced perhaps another risk vector for your organization in trying to secure this if this doesn't start to make your head hurt when you think about all of the risks and challenges around this explosion of AI that's coming for your organization we're in the early days of this imagine where we'll be six months from now a year from now let me illustrate the point by going into another example if you started with that chatbot where it was simple enough I was using one service in this case open AAI and again it was an input output sort of thing typically that grows and we expand from there to multiple use cases across the organization so great again I've got one provider easy enough to manage that but as we start to splinter into using different products or different versions of their products each of these now has its own update schedule it's got maintenance that needs to be performed some of them are being deprecated some of them are more expensive i've got to manage all of that complexity and this is just with one provider if I now start to look at using multiple LLM providers different tools different services each of them have their own challenges around upgrades maintenance overhead that I'll need to support for carrying that you can see this picture is becoming much more complex if I then start lowering in additional data sources information from our organization that I want these agents to use that I want these models to be able to process again we've added another layer of complexity that is further complicated by adding in those core applications that our business relies on now I've got integration calls and tool calls MCP that I have to manage all of this is then added into what we do with the user and what do I need to know about that customer that employee that's interacting with it maintaining some of that history that's of course assuming all this is just on the input side if we now want to write that back and have two-way integrations we've multiplied the level of complexity that's happening here across this and you can start to see how difficult this is going to be to manage if we then want to add in fine-tuning and do some custom prompting that is unique to our organization i've got a whole host of things here that are moving that can be broken that have to be maintained and you start to see how quickly untenable this becomes for your organization again we are in the beginning of this but you will need some level of management and that is exactly what our orchestration platform provides to you is a way to bring all this together to know that you've got some management a single control plane for all of your maintenance upgrading building security issues all in one tool set aging orchestration allows you to bring this together in a way that is seamless i can see all of the agents happening across the organization i can see what they're accessing what information is being passed between them i can maintain these things i can make the updates swapping between models giving you again one way to sustain all of that AI across the different units within your business and the different users who are trying to access it as well as visibility into its performance insights into security concerns and other challenges that the organization may be facing this platform allows you to quickly build across make it very easy to use it in a no code or low code way all the way up to your pro code so I can go in and build agents for very specific capabilities i get insight into how they're performing i can verify the security the information that's been passed we full full DLP controls to monitor what information is going in block sensitive information that maybe we wouldn't want that employee to share they may have been trying to do the right thing but still creating a risk with it we can protect all that and again all this done with an open integration architecture that allows you to talk to any of your core systems applications across the business a lot of emphasis here on security because again we are in the early days you're going to see more and more threats piling up and the need to be able to manage that all the way from development and building through to runtime and the different challenges that you'll have to support across that this includes the ability to intercept prompt injection attacks to do red teaming testing across the business and look for those weaknesses those vulnerabilities before the bad guys find them and also to monitor for shadow AI those users that might be going out and trying to do things with AI that could create risk i've talked about MCP and again the way that we can approach this is also unique allowing you to create ephemeral uh environments to set up those MCP connections and then blow them away once they've been loaded so we don't maintain any credentials we don't maintain any of the data uh zero retention in a way that protects your systems and the information and also keeps you compliant with any regulations may be under we do all this also for A2A giving you a way to manage those integrations maintain an inventory of them and also be able to terminate them at any point when you see an issue or a problem or if we detect something across one of our systems all this on top of the intelligent routing that ability that I mentioned of being able to move quickly between different providers knowing that a new model comes out you're going to want to be able to swap to it uh you may even want to be able to route within specific agents so that if we know uh a user's query is better served by a lowcost model versus a high cost high sophistication one to be able to do that on the fly very very important and of course all this also within the security fabric if we know that there's a risk with one of these that we can route between them uh included in our product we also offer a full library of agents you'll find over 700 agents existing within the product that allow you to quickly tackle a number of use cases across the business again consider these to be uh sort of a recipe book of pre-made agents that your organization can deploy right off the bat to solve problems across your business lastly our product can be hosted in any number of ways we offer it as a cloud service you can host it on prem or in your own cloud or as a hybrid model between these two understanding that we have hosting capabilities across the globe uh or if you want to use your own data center we're prepared to support it that way as well a lot of flexibility um I'll wrap up by saying our company is here we're exhibiting uh today we are one of the fastest growing providers of AI orchestration tools in the world we have 11 offices around the world including here in Singapore uh and are growing very quickly to meet the needs of our global customers around the world i saw a lot of you taking pictures if you'd like to get a copy of the slides you will find them through this QR code or we'll also be doing demonstrations at our booth you're welcome to come get a copy of the slides and see a little bit about the product we're just outside the hall here and you can find our booth there i thank you for the time it's been a pleasure to address you and I hope to speak more today",
