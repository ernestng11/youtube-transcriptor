datadriven and a more scientific practice of law and in particular how AI and dialogue with disciplines outside the law are helping shape that shift so to do this I'm going to look back at the writing of one of America's great jurists writing over a hundred years ago and this is Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr uh his life story as you may be able to tell from looking at his desk is very interesting uh before I went to law school I worked for a couple years in investment banking which I thought was tough and grueling uh before Oliver Wendel Holmes went to law school he served in the Union Army in the Civil War where he was wounded three times uh different time and his legal career was distinguished uh the New York Times has called him the second most notable US Supreme Court justice in history um by name recognition he's probably the first his theories are still taught today if you've heard the term clear and present danger that's Holmes now what I find most interesting about Holmes is the last writing that he ever did before join the joining the Supreme Court in fact this is his last extrajudicial writing he would ever do um the topic was the beginning of a new way of thinking about the practice of law he called it law in science and science in law and the key argument that Holmes makes in this piece uh in his own words is that the legal profession should make a substitution of quantitative for qualitative judgments i'm going to repeat that because it's so important uh a substitution of quantitative for or qualitative quantitative for qualitative judgments now this was wildly futuristic in 1899 um to put things in context for you when Holmes wrote this down the modern field of statistics was 20 to 30 years away from what we would recognize it as today uh the term computer meant a person with a ledger the core of his argument though is more relevant than ever it is centered in his observation that the legal field operates in general experiential terms so to make this real you all have probably seen something similar to this um and likely interacted with a lawyer that is working in general experiential terms in the commercial context at companies you work at uh here's what it looks like um and I'm sure you've seen this before it's usually accompanied by an email that says \"Well we've never seen that before or we can't agree to that.\" And a markup that looks like this and all of that information comes from a lawyer's experience from the algorithm that lives in their head and sadly this experiential practice of law is the norm but Holmes tells us there is a different way and because of AI and dialogue with other disciplines outside the law that shift is happening today for instance at Ironclad our legal team can tell you not just why they are agreeing to this clause but what statistical effect agreeing to it has on our operations our general council can say for instance that conversion rate of our contract is increased by 5% uh when we shift to a more standard indemnification clause that conforms more closely with the version we frequently see from our vendors so AI obviously a big part of the shift in that datadriven practice of law and an insight like that but so is another radical practice for lawyers talking to non- lawyers uh and in this case the lawyers on our marketing team uh they deal with metrics all the time just like most business people and can you imagine interviewing a marketer or hiring a marketer who says ah I don't believe in measuring the conversion rate of our website um and instead only relied on their intuition for improving it it would be pretty absurd but that's the way we most lawyers practice law today um and I think if we do our jobs right uh and if Hol's vision comes to reality it will be just as absurd for a lawyer to make a statement like that or work that way sometime in the near future generative AI obviously a particularly relevant tool for the legal profession it's good at working with semistructured text uh and as context windows get bigger it gets better we've seen what happens with computing capability when underlying technology continuously improves and this would have excited Holmes uh because he saw the way towards a more scientific practice of law depends on having the right tools lawyers can't do this just on their own and the way he articulates it is that any solution in general terms seems to me a mark to mark a want of analytic power and what is AI if not a thousandfold increase in analytic power so I want to pose a question uh what would a similar prediction Moore's law look like for the output of lawyers and I've kind of faciciously put down a new law here that AI will dramatically reduce the time that it takes attorneys to produce the same work product if we get anywhere close to this it will have profound effects on the legal profession for instance Kirkland and Ellis uh world's largest law firm made 8 bill 8.8 billion in total revenue last year which is amazing and to do that they had to employ 3,828 attorneys if something like this were to apply Kirkland and Ellis would be able to achieve the same amount of revenue with 3.8 attorneys in 10 years um from when this law starts to take effect uh I actually had to you know I'm a lawyer because I had to pull up a calculator to make sure I was doing that calculation correctly um and honestly my actual views of how this is going to play out are a little bit more nuanced than than that but I think it illustrates the scale of change we're talking about when we talk about applying generative AI to the legal profession uh and I actually don't think this change stops with just the role of the lawyer the more scientific practice of law will change the world of legal disputes of the type encountered by everyday citizens uh this is the Magna Carta um and it's like the origin of the right to a jury of peers uh it goes through the US Constitution and and obviously is still around today um but we all know kind of how unpredictable and imprecise peers can be holmes certainly did if you go uh read his full paper and one might rationally believe a future state of the world where an AI trained on one's peers is superior to those actual peers resolving disputes there are contract negotiators there are really passionate group and I've been working in this field for about 14 years this is by far the most exciting time of my career so uh one of the things that I appreciate about Reing Holmes is he doesn't want to just throw away art as the profession moves to a science his father was a poet uh and his vision is really that quantitative thinking can enhance our lives and enhance our appreciation of the work so I love this quote um comparing the qualitative casual listener to the technical quantitative listener and the beauty in to me isn't that the appreciation isn't lost on the technical listener it's only enhanced knowing the chords and the keys doesn't mean you have to lose the tune and that should be the way we think about AI in the legal profession how we build in quantitative scientific datadriven practices into an ancient profession without losing an appreciation of the art so I'll leave you with that note uh thanks for listening it's been fun to get to a chance to share this passion of mine with you and I guarantee you this is going to be the only article from 1899 from the Harvard Law Review you here at SuperAI um and come find me if you want to talk about more about the history of law and how AI is shaping the future of the profession thank you",
