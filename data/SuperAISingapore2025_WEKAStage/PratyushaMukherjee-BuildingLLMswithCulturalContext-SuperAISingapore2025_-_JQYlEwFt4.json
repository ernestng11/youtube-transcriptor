amazing potential that AI can unlock and I think we all agree that AI AI can serve as such an incredible multiplier for so many different use cases my sharing session today though touches on a slightly more sobering note what is the opposite of a multiplier what happens to people who are left behind and cannot benefit from the potential that AI brings result is an exponential loss and my effort together with numerous partners across the Southeast Asian region to help address that loss one thing I want you all to note is this story is going to be a deeply Southeast Asian story but it applies across so many different low-resourced contexts so think about your own fields your own niches your own languages or cultures where this might apply because each of the steps I'll be going through are generalizable and can be applied across all of these i'm going to start by giving you a quick overview of Southeast Asia for those of you who are new to the region we have 11 different countries over 650 people and so many different languages i mean Singapore alone has four national languages Malay Chinese Tamil and English and even across those four you can see the incredible differences in the performance of our top LLMs today and when you multiply that across the complexity of,200 languages you can imagine why we see these results three out of four people across the region do not benefit from the transformative potential of AI all right I'm going to share with you three different segments that our project has currently focused on but again this is entirely generalizable beyond that um since they're all going to be very personal stories I've added these three numbers just to remind you of that scale that it applies across first imagine moving to a brand new country limited financial resources you're starting a new job you're grappling with complex regulations in a language you completely do not understand no social capital very little support that you can rely on we see this with the 25 million migrant workers across Southeast Asia today without AI they have to struggle through this with limited support i'll share a little bit more about how our project sealed has been looking to tackle this next agriculture i mean it can be difficult to imagine with Singapore and our gleaming skyscrapers but agriculture happens to be one of the key sectors for our region and we have a 100 million small farmers who are grappling with climate change pests dealing with sometimes unscrupulous middlemen and having to deal with the financial challenges that come with the global economy today without AI they do not have access to this up-to-date information that could essentially transform their livelihoods and then finally for 200 million children across our region without AI in the best case scenario say the child actually does have a teacher in their classroom they are being left out of the of the opportunity to have a personalized tutor who can greatly accelerate their learning journey and at worst I personally have seen multiple classrooms where you have students from grades 1 to 10 altogether being served by a single teacher with AI there's the potential to make up for this drastic lack of teacher resources that we see across Southeast Asia and that's not being fully unlocked for now it seems so strange almost ludicrous that I'm talking about this concept of being without AI at this conference today super AI when we're seeing about all the incredible um things that AI can already do so why let me take the example of one of my um close colleagues I work with across the region so so in Southeast Asia as I mentioned there's so many different languages and I'd say if you use one of our very common uh messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or Line you'll see there's a very clear distinction for those who speak languages where they're Latin scripts people rely a lot on text keyboard and LLMs are generally a lot more advanced there for those with scripts that are non-Latin however you'll see everyone uses voice messages and when you look at that voice being transcribed into text by even our leading AIs today there's a big big performance gap and that is just at step one now think about the potential AI has with agentic workflows if you aren't able to communicate with each other as humans and with AIS all of that those future steps are blocked i'm going to delve a little bit into the why of this uh we first started our journey on this uh a couple of years ago uh and one of the first things that came um across very very clearly is the data asymmetry that creates this issue when you look at the open web data um which essentially all large language models are trained on over 99% of that is in English southeast Asian languages are a small minute proportion of the remaining 1% and even there getting high quality factual grounded data is extremely difficult you'll see a lot of advertising content for example or nonverified data that doesn't necessarily translate to the performance uh uplift that we require we started off project sealed to address first this data challenge and then very soon we realized that was not enough so we moved on from data and I'll talk through some of the model training techniques that we've used and then finally the use cases that we're exploring through to today so if anyone has any applications that they'd like to explore would love to connect with you after this how do we balance these scales for Southeast Asia and again as I mentioned earlier all of these are generalizable so think of any lower resource context number one get that representative data and I'll share a bit more about how you can do that number two what are the model training techniques across from pre-training to post- training to fine-tuning that you can use to incorporate that data and see that performance uplift in real world use cases and third contextualize validation nothing is any good if you can't evaluate how well you're doing and identify where the future gaps are so first on data sets uh we started off with uh actually engaging uh native speakers across the Southeast Asian languages in settings like the one pictured here we found that text prompts for example were not as effective at truly capturing the cultural data we wanted uh and to give you an example right if you show someone an image prompt instead of a night market the way folks of native speakers of different languages describe that same image prompt is so much more nuanced than if you gave them a text prompt up front that defines the market for them we collected over 20,000 of these both the audio uh as well as the transcribed versions and I'll tell you why that became important later on that was the beginning of the journey and you'll see we have expanded massively since then through the help of community partners governments enterprises universities other like-minded organizations across all of those 11 Southeast Asian countries all contributing to this effort for high quality open source data then we realized to make this data truly helpful we wanted to put it in the hands of developers in the region who could build for their own use cases to empower to realize the differences that AI based applications could make in these fields if you could play the video for us I'll show you a quick demo and Aquarium is live on beta right now so you can go check it out what we wanted to do is make this as accessible as possible so you'll see very clearly listed the specific context of each of these data sets their open source license how they can be used across pre-training post-training across the different domains as well so for instance if I'm looking for um building data sets uh for a Thai healthcare use case that's something I can very clearly do not only in English but also in my native language and a huge thanks to all the partners listed here for helping us get to the beta launch of Aquarium and would love your support in both accessing these data sets contributing and making them used in the real world all right moving on to the second scale model training techniques this uh calm method was developed by my colleagues at Google Deep Mind to address the fundamental issue with fine-tuning you have a centralized large general purpose model Gemini for instance here when you try and make um a fine-tuned version of that specializing in a particular language you see a lot of catastrophic forgetting what does that mean say I'm adding a bunch of Indonesian data the a fine-tuned model often tends to forget some of those baseline summarization reasoning coding capabilities that were there in the gen general purpose model it's also very expensive and then you end up with multiple model copies which is inefficient km provides an alternative where through composition you have a single model copy that retains much better the existing skills in the large language general purpose model and you'll see again this is um across v various different fields but with languages and Southeast Asian languages in particular we have really brought calm forward to um prove out some of these capabilities there's a paper online happy to point you to uh the technical details for anyone interested afterwards and then finally on evaluation when you do not have a sense of how well you're doing it's very hard to direct further resources towards plugging those gaps everyone here must be familiar with Ella Marina where you can see the capabilities of our top models across different fields for the longest time it was uh very focused on English uh now we have Japanese Korean and Chinese added from uh our region but nothing no Southeast Asian language yet that's what prompted us to work with our partners AI Singapore to create the Sea Helm leaderboard which you can access to understand the capabilities across Southeast Asian languages um for the top models out today we started with um instruction uh following proficiency in chat and some linguistic tasks and now we're further expanding it to look at for example longer context performance i want to leave you with this note uh that truly acknowledges the only reason we've been able to make the progress so far it is the partnerships that have sustained this effort and made it um long term and this is an open invitation for any of you who operate out of the region and would like to contribute to reach out to us and to further incentivize you I'll give you a peak of what's next uh for our project sealed work group aquarium as I mentioned building that out getting more adoption getting more use cases and multimodality um we are seeing a lot of very interesting use cases with interled text and image data audio as I mentioned is super critical especially for a region where uh there may be certain contexts with limited and low literacy rates um also looking at safety and value alignment which is critical not just in a general form but taking into account local cultural context and then of course going our community across the region i'd like to leave you with a few of the lessons we've learned through this journey with hope that you can apply this as you continue um in your own fields on challenges the number one lesson was that data matters and this getting to the right data is not trivial we have worked with agencies where all the data exists um but it's all locked up in cabinets it's in paper form getting that digitized and getting it truly used in LLM today has definitely been a journey and to facilitate that we've had to build bridges across our partner community and understand the incentives um and top priorities finally what gets measured gets managed and that has really been a key driver for our efforts around objective evaluation benchmarks that can guide us as a compass on learning points whenever there have been challenges in terms of the future direction of project field reentering back to those users and use cases where this is truly making a difference has helped us guide our next steps next openness all of these data sets are open sourced all of the efforts across data collection we've had playbooks with Aquarium we've gone one step further to have a single Southeast Asian platform that anyone can access and similarly for the model training techniques and evaluation benchmarks and finally adapt uh this is such a fastmoving space and my my hope today is with all your support we can ensure that AI acts as a multiplier for as many people as possible across the region thank you",
