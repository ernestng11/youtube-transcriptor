    "aggregated_text": "good afternoon everyone my name is carl chan i'm the founder and ceo of sourcey we're an agentic ai sourcing platform that help consumer brands turn ideas into products and today i'm happy to be here to share a little bit about our lessons learned um implementing like aic ai in a b2b setting hopefully it will be helpful for all of you so what is agentic ai if you are like me you have tried you know looking up the definition of agentic ai online and it's very confusing i think the easiest way to understand what an agentic ai is is by telling you what an agentic ai isn't right so like um traditional llm even if you add a reasoning layer on top like a chain of thoughts a reasoning technology is still basically a next token predictor right is giving you recommendations um or prediction based on the user prompt that you have input it literally cannot do anything right other than recommendation later on if you add on um a tool element to it if you ask the ai to follow a predefined workflow to use different tools to achieve a goal it's much higher in agency now but it's still not truly you know agentic per se right the next stage is actually allowing ai to plan its own actions right so like an agentic ai is really uh able to understand the environment around this plan its own action execute and then reflect that's an agentic ai right and then of course you can also take it one notch up and think about a multi- aent system right when you have one orchestrator agent asking different sub aents to do different things and that's uh even higher in agency so an agentic ai in summary is really an autonomous llm application that can plan execute and reflect right when you think about it it's deciding its own trajectory and it's also executing its own actions without human nudging it all the time right and that's amazing and if we talk about agentic ai we just have to talk about mcp um model context uh protocol right what exactly is it i'm pretty sure all of you have heard of it um um heard of this term before and an mcp you can think of it as a way for the agent to make use of the different tools right it's basically a protocol or a framework for the agent to understand what are the tools that are available um how to use the different tools uh the right way and then basically execute and call on the different tools right so like in summary you can think of like an agentic uh uh tool is looking at into the different two boxes so each mcp server is a two box right with different tools available in it and then it will find the right toolbox it will find the right tool within the right toolbox and then finally it will use the tool the right way that's what an mcp is used for so now with the basic out of the way right how is sourcey implementing aic ai in real real life before i talk about saucy i want to tell you a little bit of a short story right zara um the pioneer in fast fashion right launched 30,000 products uh in 2024 shiin however a chinese company launched two million products in in the same year how can she launch 70 times more products than sara right it doesn't have 70 times more um sourcing agents or designers the way to do it is through ai right and what we believe in is we can democratize this ai superpower for countless um small and emerging brands right and we are also observing the same trend across other categories as well be it home and living built-in cosmetics and baby and mom right so why do we need an agentic um ai platform for sourcing let's first think about when an agentic ai shines right an agentic ai shines when there is a very tedious workflow when there are a lot of unstructured data and that's exactly sourcing traditionally when a small brand is trying to develop and source a new product what it does is it goes to different data analytics platforms find the trends and then go to different sourcing sites maybe fly to uh guangjo to kanton fair use different offline agents to find thousands of different manufacturers and then negotiate bilaterally with each of the manufacturer one by one and then finally if you're lucky enough to find the right deal you you still have to arrange the logistics all the hassles until the product arrive right by the time you can launch a new product and go to market is already 6 to 12 months but then at sourcy we are using a gentic ai to help consumer brands small and medium emerging brands to really use one single source a consolidated super supplier as we call ourselves to turn idea into product and sort much smarter faster and get higher margin so here is how it works right so like our users are the emerging brands right like be it a merchandiser a founder um a head of supply chain and then they interact with source in two ways either through our customer portal or through our shopify app and then when they propose um a sourcing request to source right let's say i want to source the most uh viral uh tennis skirt uh and go to market with it under my own brand what our sourcing um agent would do is to orchestrate a set of sub aents to turn this idea into a reality so how exactly does it work let's say our master agent in this case right is the orchestrator is basically taking in the requirement and understand what needs to be achieved and plan out the action so that the sub agent can then carry out the action and achieve the goal right so it starts by looking at the trends right what is currently trending on e-commerce and social media so it will orchestrate the trend sub agents to go to different e-commerce sites uh social media platforms to look at what is trending what are the top sellers what are the top features amongst the top sellers and what are some of the things that consumers are asking for that are not currently available yet right this is defining the trend and then thereafter the master orchestrator agent would then call on the next set of sub agents to turn this trend and idea into a manufacturable product right and is through doing deep research on the product category as well as uh fetching our proprietary uh database which is a knowledge graph uh database and then thereafter once we are able to pinpoint specifically what specs need to be manufactured in order to turn this product into a reality we then another set of sub agents right that are actually talking to the suppliers giving them instruction telling them uh what is the target price negotiate with them and then finally finalize the order and have the order made and shipped to our customers so from an idea to a reality we can achieve everything within one to two months and throughout this whole process what is the most important is our master agent right the orchestrator agent is actually interacting with our memories what is our memories is the thousands of successful and unsuccessful sourcing requests that we have processed in the past so that it can actually learn from its own mistakes and get better over time that's um how we implement aic ai it sounds perfect on paper until i tell you about all the lessons learned right so here we go the first lesson that we have learned is not a all ai should be agentic and agentic ai really shines under four cond conditions right number one when you need a very versatile system when you cannot predict uh all sort of queries that you're going to get right that's when an agentic ai shines number two the cost of error cannot be too high because like if your your cost of error is going to cost you the whole business you don't want your agent to just wing it right you want to predefine the workflow for it to follow and gate and even have human in the loop right number three is you cannot really specify all the ideal steps ahead of time um and and you want the agent to figure that out right that's also a prerequisite because if you can really map out all the ideal processes chances are it's better off to have a workflow than an agent and then finally the use case cannot be overly latency sensitive right because like an agent needs to think it needs to fetch different tools and sometimes it takes hours if not longer right to finish a task if that's the case and and your your user is waiting for you in front of the laptop then that's not ideal so just uh understand agentic ai is amazing but only under certain uh circumstances and if you don't trust me trust andrew because he also said the same thing and then number two is a thumb ai can actually orchestrate very smart ai very well initially we were under the assumption that oh our orchestration layer should be the smartest right we should use the most powerful uh model give it the most uh uh number of tools as well as give it the most uh autonomy but our experience told us that actually that's not the case at the very uh high level you want to implement more guard rails and you want to have as much of a predefined kind of like instruction as possible yes you still give it at the autonomy to make decision but at the high level you want to give it enough uh guidance and that's because that's also the gatekeeper right that's the gatekeeper before your result go to your user you want it to be um um following your um ideal definition of good right whereas like the sub agents that are working for the agent they can do anything they want right because at the end of the day you want to leverage the power of autonomous uh ai and then you can implement that at the sub aent number three is what we call the impossible trinity we realize that at the end of the day an ai agent can only achieve two out of three things at the same time right versatility capability and reliability if you want a f very versatile uh ai that can handle a lot of use cases chances are it cannot do too much it cannot be too powerful or else it will not be uh reliable or if you want the uh ai agent to be very powerful it can do a lot then chances are it cannot be too versatile and handle too many use cases right or else it would not be reliable so like um pick your battles decide which one uh which way you want to go with and then uh don't fall into the middle uh part right when when your your system is not reliable that's the worst the way we think about it at sourcey is at the orchestrator layer we want it to be very versatile but the that particular orchestration agent doesn't have to do too much the only thing it does is routing and and basically calling on different sub agent but at the sub agent level we want it to be very very capable and chances are when you when you achieve that the sub agent is not very versatile right so that's how we are thinking about this number four is uh complexity equals chaos um when uh you have a very big agent right it's very hard to have observability and very hard to reproduce result and basically debug right it's also very hard for you to implement evals uh across the whole process so our advice here is spin off a sub agent whenever possible whenever you see uh enough like of a complexity in the task that it is doing number five is size doesn't matter right like uh we have tried using a very complex agent and a very simple le agent with a bit of a reflection element in it right and very often if the task is not that complicated the simple agent outshines the bigger agent right and it's just like sometimes the smaller models outperform the bigger models for simpler task because the bigger models tend to overthink so always increase the autonomy or increase the power of your agent when necessary number six uh is more tools are not always better like uh at the very beginning we try to put all the tools in one monolithic like mcp server right like agent you know uh go crazy we have uh all sort of tools uh available to you and chances are just like human the agent will have decision fatigue because it doesn't know which tool it should use and which tool it shouldn't uh under the different scenarios so try to set up different tool boxes different mcp uh servers that contain different tools so that the agent will not have decision fatigue number seven is um write better tool description right just like a human agent needs to learn to use the tool and ideally you can tell them exactly when and when not to use the tool right by giving positive and negative examples number eight is memory matters the agent needs to remember what is happening for the ongoing query as well as what has happened in the past that it it should be aware of right so the more it can learn from its experience the better is the performance number nine is don't do too much on the fly right whatever pre-processing and pre-caching you can do uh do that first because like agency um is great but then it also leads to latency and you don't want your user to be waiting for too long and then finally and the most importantly llm can still make very dumb mistakes so like one of the examples that we have is we ask our agent to pick a a fabric type that fulfill our customer requirement which is organic cotton denim right and then the agent was thinking that oh because cotton can be organic so this cotton must be organic and it's like the dumbest mistake that it can make right so just understand as much as we hype up ai llm can still be quite dumb and we need to be very careful and introduce guardrails i know we only have limited time so i i was like kind of like breezing through all the different mistakes that we have made but um um if you want to learn more about how uh we are implementing agentic ai please uh visit our booth over there and then also like uh please uh stay connected thank you very much",
