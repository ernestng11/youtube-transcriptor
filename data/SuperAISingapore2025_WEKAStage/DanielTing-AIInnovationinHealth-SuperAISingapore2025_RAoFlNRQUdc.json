    "aggregated_text": "uh today hi everyone my name is uh Daniel um I am a MD PhD uh in my daytime I see eye patients i do eye surgeries i'm a retina surgeon on my nighttime I do computer science AI and uh in opthalmology and in health so I'm uh currently a Duke N US faculty i'm also a visiting faculty in Stanford and in fact uh two weeks ago we had a a oneweek Stanford AI health week we talked a lot about what we uh just spoke about today AI safety how do you use AI in a safe and responsible way and in health as you know the moment that your mom or your dad or your son or your daughter fall sick you come to the hospital you see a doctors and when a doctor start telling you that I'm using AI2 to diagnose your kids to diagnose your parents you'll start getting a bit tackyardic in a layman's term your heart will start to race so I think for the next uh 10 15 minutes I'm going to share with you some of the journey that I personally have undergone for the last 10 to 15 years um all the way until now and see where we are doing and where we are heading so I think this is some of my financial disclosure right now i don't actually need to pitch this to everyone sitting here the reason why you're here you're interested in AI but I just wanted to actually highlight that we have actually gone through different iterations so super AI this is a conference but AI is a 70 year old technology so it started at Alan Turing's time in World War II with him cracking the enigma code all the way to Chad 3.5 started two and a half to three years ago they have actually changed how we think and how we live i wanted just to remind everyone in science in technology one of the greatest award that a a person or a scientist can get is called the Nobel Prize and I'm pretty sure 100% of people know what Nobel Prize is last year in 2024 we have three computer scientists who won the Nobel Prize award two in the physiology space and one in the chemistry space and we know Jensen said that right right now no matter whether you are currently building a hardware company a pharmaceutical company a drug device company you will need the second brain which is AI which is software so you need two factories to work together to make your device to make your drugs to make your hospital to make your agriculture to make your vehicle smarter so this is what we know covid time is just uh you know I mean has just passed about four or five years ago and this is one of the time that has turbocharged the adoption of AI and teleopmology as a new part of the care delivery in health this is a article that we published in nature medicine back then and Victor Chao is currently the president of national academy of medicine in the United States so we co-authored this paper just two months after the outbreak of covid so this article was actually picked up by the US CDC to actually educate the world how we could actually adopt AI and digital technology to provide care when the whole country or worldwide health care system is experiencing a lockdown so that was just four to five years ago so if you look at the chart here for the last three to five years is 2020 to 2025 so this is a chart that has just stopped at 2020 that is a pregen AI era and we already have seen many AI interests has sparked off tremendously in the healthcare space on different AI the task the different AI domains and different medical specialist if I were to summarize what AI has done in health for the last 15 to 20 years you can start from the top so it started as a numbers analysis it goes on to a picturebased a computer vision era and right now for the last two and a half years is a text numbers and as well as image and videos and speech and that's what we call multimodel irrespective of what technological changes that we are seeing on the top we always need to make sure that the AI technology the moment that you use it on your hand to deliver care when a patient is sitting right next to you you got to use it in a safe and responsible way no different from the moment that you put a pair of your hand on the steering wheel you got to drive the car in a safe and responsive way we do not need you to be a car engineer to know how the car is being made but we the moment that you drive a car on the road you need to be safe and you need to be responsible so this is the era where I started so FA Fay is my Stanford colleague she put together a image net uh a database called the image net that has actually changed how we think about training AI system so I started with the pixelbased convolution neuronet uh the era where we actually not training we we we we have a VG net after the Alex net back then was a untrained CNN era the moment that the image net comes out then we started pre-training CNN with the imageet database including the medical imaging analysis so if you look at transformer architecture it was uh described in uh by the Google uh researcher in 2017 attention is all you need so this paper has really changed how we actually think about the backend architecture about convolutional neuronets all the way to the transformer architecture and you look at the version one two three four and many others all up until the mixture experts multi- aent system the deepse right manners quen these are all the different the newest latest AI optimization techniques that one we actually seen in the gen generative AI space and AI can never work alone so the moment that you come to the hospital setting you come to the healthcare setting you got to actually remember that AI has to always talk to many different stuff so that includes the AR technology the VR technology your HIM system your EHR system your variables there's many others things that you actually can see on the slides if you were to actually build a AI technology and use it in a healthcare and commercialize it and scale it and get your startup company to get listed in NASDAQ and New York stock exchange this will be the whole entire journey have to undergo right and sadly speaking we always see 90% of the AI ideas AI papers stop at the ideation and stop at the publication stage the moment that you ask any AI developers or AI designers in health and asking them hey is anyone using your solutions in the clinic less than 5% say yes and 3 to 5 years later for those who say yes is your solution is still being used in the clinic less than 1% would say yes so this is what we call the value of death in health right so if you were to actually do the first 90% low hanging fruit well if you were to submit your paper high publications right a lot of uh uh of yourself uh AI developers some of your applications may you know uh apply to the healthcare settings and if you work with the clinician this is the number one thing they care about is my paper is going to be submitted to science to nature to you know so those are the things that they care about so if you were to do that this is the top five things you have to understand first what is the question where is your data is going to come from and what is the brain that you're going to select to actually you know use your data to build the algorithms and the backend architecture how are you going to actually create the operating system and of course what is the primary endpoint because if you were to submit this to the US FDA to the EMA to the Chinese FDA to Singapore HSA you all have to know this and of course when the moment that your AI solution is being approved the next question is how do you use it right am I going to deploy in the cloud am I going to use it in a laptop what is the data ecosystem how is the data going to flow to your AI algorithms and how are you going to protect the data that comes into your AI system so all these little things is all critical for you to continue to provide your solutions in the healthcare settings and of course the last but not least the money we hate to talk about money but who's going to pay what is the reimbursement methodology the strategy for your solutions to continue on to be actually be paid for and to be to be used so I just wanted to highlight a few things right in AI deployment it's either you use AI in a 100% automated way or you keep the human in the loop so it's as simple as that and in the US FDA the route if you were to submit any AI as a medical device route is either refer not refer a lot of them has gone through the US 510k route and if you're more high risk is treat or not treat that would actually be you know considered either a class C or even a high-risisk device regulatory approval from different countries are different so you always have to think about that at right at the outset so that you don't actually need to revamp your AI technology that you have built you know tirelessly for the last three to five years again what is a business model am I actually look at B2B am I B to C am I to B to C so those are the different uh business model that we actually seen health economic analysis is very important because that actually helps you to actually look at if I were to use AI I in the real world settings what is my return of investment these are the two papers that we actually published in the lenses series journals this is one of the uh solutions that currently using in the AI national DR screening program where we published a paper in 2017 in JAMAMA so back then we use a pre-trained VG net and we found that using the health economic analysis that guides us how to use it in the real world settings so semi-automated way based on what we've actually done it shows as actually most cost effective the combination of human and AI intelligence so this is currently we use 100% AI to screen for those that AI is deemed abnormal then you will go through the human for a second read I you know I always like to ask this do do does anyone not know what this is right so and when I actually show this icon to my surprise more than 50% of people still get it wrong so anyone please shout it out Meta AI yes wow one of the first time what about this deep sick yes i like it yeah so this is a paper that we published uh one and a half years ago currently it's been cited more than 100 times per month so that was just four months after chat 3.5 was released if you can look at the submission date so we know gen AI applications in health is mostly broad broadly divided to the text medical imaging and speech ambient AI and this is the two articles that we then published to say how do we use it in a safe and responsible way and we look at the different AI uh training techniques you go from the prom all the way to the pre-training you use like the a 140 gig or you can use the laptop base uh you know the uh the GPU power all the way to B200 Blackwell you know the high-end compute power but I wanted to draw your attention to the bottommost I started in a supervised label pixelbased CNN era so right now you can see the evolution of the AI training techniques is going from supervised to weekly supervised to unsupervised to unsupervised to supervised fine-tuning to supervised to reinforcement learning so this is where we have seen the whole entire journey of the the the gen space of course this is just a snapshot on the closed source versus the open source on the tiny small intermediate and the mega models and I just wanted to share this is something that uh in Singapore and Duke NS we have just spun off uh startup to look at the agentic sovereign small language model the resource efficient AI models to help the healthcare administrator to calculate the clinical audits so you can look the the task that require five more than 500 hours previously the time when we actually use enigma the small language model to automate a lot of the task force it bring right down to the seven hours it's more than 90% reduction in workload so this is one of the media release that we have had in a recent ATX summit with ro and SD engineering and what is enigma enigma is world war II the one that Alan Turing has cracked to to win the All so right now we are leveraging a mixture of experts small language models that do not need internet connection as you know in healthcare similar to many other industry we have to handle many sensitive data so this is some of the things that we are currently doing that can connect and can be connected to the different databases and the uh different um uh the file format so this is uh the different stuff that currently we have already done on the pharmaceutical the industry the insurance the finance and the human resource operation as well so I think this is my last slide so data privacy rights of use the data provenence the IP contamination is always an issues gen AI is very broad so we do need a lot of the governing framework to actually govern that so this is the smart nation this is our PM has actually announced the 2.0 zero smart nation strategy this is where we actually are advocating a safe and responsible use in the healthcare settings this is our labs uh that we've done quite a few uh you know the AI the you know the um the healthcare related application for last uh 10 years and this is so far what we've got we invite um you know the industry players the startups the uh the MNC's to come to Singh and do n us please reach out this is some of our pipelines of our AI talents in our healthcare system and this is the interns that come from MIT Cambridge and Oxford to join our labs and this is also some of the clinician entrepreneurs that we have incubated and now they have gone on to the industry and this is the last um I'm not sure whether yeah this is the last 30 seconds demo that I want to share with the world in the past we actually need three months to four months to write a systematic review right now by feeding this into enigma we can do it within in less than 60 seconds times with 3,000 words of a very well researched literature and a very wellsighted references from the different evidence as you can see from the screen and once this is clicked and you'll see the whole entire table of contents all the way from backgrounds to the searching strategy all the way to the conclusion and the references so with this I thank you",
