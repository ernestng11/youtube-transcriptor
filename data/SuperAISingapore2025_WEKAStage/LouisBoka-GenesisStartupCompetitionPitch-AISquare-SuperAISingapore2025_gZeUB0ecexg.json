    "aggregated_text": "hello Singapore Um my name is Lewis I'm the co-founder and CEO of uh AI square And u if you've been watching the news lately you've been seeing a narrative about the cutting edge Everything that you see about AI uh super powerful models What I see is a story about power but not necessarily a story about control And this narrative has inspired me to start this company called AI square All right The truth is that AI is everywhere Uh you see it in the news you see it on TV but it's not where it matters the most What I mean by that is that the industries that run the world infrastructure logistics um critical infrastructure they never completed their digital transformation Uh they still run on legacy and even if they could run the best possible model there's the question of sovereignty If you can't deploy it yourself it's not your AI So in order to tackle this problem we knew that we had to build using a radical different approach So we built those industrial solver models ISMs They need first to be able to understand the world in 3D You can feed it images CAD floor plans BIM you name it It's going to create a representation of its understanding of the facility you want to tackle Once it understands the world or the facility it can design it can generate designs that you can build What I mean by that is you've seen models like midjourney that are able to produce astonishing pictures Our approach is how about designing a data center a factory a new terminal in an airport that a construction company can use that output to start building today And once you have created your facility you can operate in real time by plugging your SCADA your IoT your security footage and interrogate the space LLMs are intelligence based on text We provide intelligence based on space This isn't science fiction It's already solving real world problems And our story actually started in Singapore where Chungi Airport Group was the very first comp um agency to award us a contract So this is technology built for the edge but we scale in the cloud So we're part of the AWS startup program and u since we're essentially selling sovereignty um we can use technologies such as Sage Maker to provide AI insights where the decisions are made rather than where the GPUs live in the cloud And all the contributions that our customer teams uh add by using the technology is then used to retrain a refined model in the cloud on the EC2 instance Uh and this newer refined model is only for that customer It never benefits their comp um their competitors We are executing this using um um a business model that is pilot to conversion Uh we on track to reach 1 million in annual recurring by October So far we have 12 enterprise clients in Japan Singapore and the US and we've had 250k inference cycles from the edge to the cloud Um our sales method is that we sell to system integrators so that we don't need to build a beefy sales team directly inhouse Um we're able to convert 40% of the pilots that we start and each deployment uh generates over 130,000 of annual recurring per per side This is a very interesting uh market because this new technology is at a crossroads between CAD software automation IoT and there's a dual there the dual use case with the defense industry Uh we're looking at over $110 billion market and we think that we can get $29 billion on that market in the next eight years Uh this was made possible because we've assembled a team with deep execution experience five exits across three continents and we recently shared our story on YouTube uh two weeks ago and we already have one year's worth of watch time generated during that time So the world is listening to what we're doing Um our seed round is not open yet but we're going to uh be targeting $5 million for a go to market to grow the team and to reinvest in the product as well One very important point is that everything that you've seen today we own the full technology stack except the infrastructure layer provided by AWS This allows us to remain independent be sovereign ourself since at a high level that's exactly what we sell Thank you very much Uh that was it for AI square Love what you're doing Um just very quick question How is it different from existing digital twin solution what would be the true differentiator in that okay So the true difference is that in the digital twin um you essentially need to hire people with that deep expertise with Autodesk's technology What we're providing is the ability for people who have no experience in that field to generate a design that a construction company can build Right now if I give you the example of uh the data center problem this morning on the stage people were talking about every six months we need to double the compute uh we're partnering with some of the major data center providers here in Singapore who are now looking at Malaysia Thailand to build the next infrastructure and the technology allows to compress the inception phase where they're thinking about how they're going to do it to how they're going uh to to build actually building it and operating the site uh all done using generative AI Hi um just wanted to check what is some of what are some of the most uh compelling use cases uh so far and which industries are you prioritizing the most compelling use cases are in uh the critical infrastructure and uh uh in the automotive sector uh as well So we operate based off Japan which is uh a perfect uh starting point for the adoption of this technology as they use a lot of legacy systems So in the port operations of auto automotive manufacturers they're able to load in the floor plan of uh the ships that they need to load with containers and uh they use uh Excel spreadsheets with the information about the containers and generatively we are proposing the most opt optimized layout to manage the uncertainty and in critical infrastructure like airports which is currently our bread and butter What we're looking at is revealing hidden intelligence that the clients had all along Uh talking about certain types of sensors that can tell you a much bigger story about what's going on in your infra in your infrastructure So there have been some cases in the past years of uh human errors with uh aircrafts on being on the runways and accidents being caused by that And now we're able to tell um air traffic control automatically without them having to install any new critical infrastructure that with 99.9% certainty there's something wrong on the runway before any incident happens And that fits in their strategy of digitalizing without necessarily having to replace the whole infrastructure",
