radically changing we're transitioning from the era of human-driven software development to agent-driven software development you can see glimpses of this today however it seems like right now we're still trying to figure out what are the pathways towards that future of agent-driven development there are incremental improvements available tools like the IDE that were primarily designed first and foremost for human beings to write every single line of code and you can add AI on top of those tools right You can add autocomplete you can add a chat assistant but undoubtedly the amount of code that we're going to write by hand is falling very quickly to zero right And we're seeing enterprises and large organizations that are saying look we got 10 15% gains in productivity when we adopted an AI native IDE but where is that 10x that all the AI practitioners are saying is going to happen Right There's a quote that's attributed to Henry Ford he said \"If I had asked people what they had wanted they would have said faster horses.\" We believe that a lot of what we are building today are more like faster horses and we need cars there are some fundamentally hard problems blocking organizations from accessing that 10x in productivity along in the realm of software dev right And so the power of that 10x comes from delegating tasks entirely and parallelizing those tasks to agents um and so we think that you need a new sort of platform to do that one that has an intuitive interface for managing and delegating tasks to agents you need centralized context from across all of your engineering data sources you need agents that produce reliably highquality output that you can actually trust and you need infrastructure that supports thousands of these agents running in parallel when you have an org of let's say five 10 or 20,000 engineers using it and so these are really hard problems but our team has spent the last two years partnering with some of the largest organizations in the world to build this exact platform um and so I'm going to just kind of talk a bit about how we see this future evolving um you know Andre Karpathy said that English is the new programming language which if you judge this by like AI Twitter or you know LinkedIn you might think that already you know AI has fully replaced software engineers but we think that that is not at all how the future is going to play out uh the vibe coding approach is not going to allow you to solve truly difficult problems especially in the enterprise you can't vibe code a Java 7 to Java 21 legacy app migration right And so we think that agents aren't a replacement for the human's role capabilities and expertise in this process but instead you can kind of think of them like climbing gear right And so building production software is still scaling a mountain ai climbing gear is not going to replace the mountaineers of today right And so better equipment is making these sort of transformations a lot more accessible to organizations but ultimately what we've seen is that software developers have this role to play of being the orchestrator and the planner of these agentic systems and so the differentiation if you're a software developer you're an engineering leader is not going to come from did I pick the right tool or am I using the right model but instead how have I transformed the way that I'm actually using agents and how is that impacting the way that we ship software um I want to start with a quick video of what's possible today with agents um and so here you can watch systems that we call droids basically ingesting a highle task grounding itself in its environment by using search using a terminal uh accessing tools uh checking the git branch on a machine and then you can see that droid come back with a plan of exactly what it's going to do in order to solve the task the user can then come back and say here's some feedback about how to actually implement that and from there the droid is going to autonomously execute on this task it's going to leverage those tools that I mentioned its ability to write code run the CLI run git commands ask the user follow-ups um and ultimately it's going to go and create a full code change that's ready to merge in CI and so you can open that up review it in GitHub and go from there right These sorts of outcomes are becoming table stakes for engineering orgs that are doing agent-driven development right The leverage that you gain when you can say go do this thing and then go check on that code and see that it's complete is unbelievably high but how can you actually achieve outcomes like this on a regular basis right You may not have seen this same sort of uh endto-end completion rate that might be because you're not using factory but that we also think that there are a couple other things that you need to think about at the heart of most AI effective uh software development is high quality context for your agents right So a lot of what we call prompt engineering is ultimately us as humans trying to mentally model what information does the agent have or does it not have right And so at factory we've investigated thousands of these agent interactions with real enterprise software developers and we kind of built this simple heruristic it turns out that AI is most likely to fail not because of the quality of LLMs lm have gotten really good but instead because of the lack of critical context required to solve the problem right And so the solution isn't just wait for smarter models it's get better at providing the right information to your agents in order to solve that task llms don't know about the morning standup they don't know about the interaction you had in the hall that changed the direction of the implementation right So you need to be able to provide those sources of data to agents in order to see success platforms like factory make that really easy but you don't need necessarily to use our tools you can also adopt this with any of the agentic coding platforms that you may be already using right And so if you expand what you're willing to show agents they become shockingly helpful i also want to talk about planning and design with agents droids are not only capable at writing code but they actually solve the harder part of software development which is figuring out what to build in the first place here is an example of a droid that's tasked with basically updating an application to use the latest model from Anthropic the droid is going to leverage internet search to find forum posts about implementation bugs that aren't in the docs it's going to search through your product implementation your PRDS look through the different architecture implementations and ultimately it's going to create this plan for how to actually execute on this problem right So planning with AI is fundamentally different from when you are planning alone you would do this search you would do this implementation but importantly you're not going to ask the agent just come up with the whole product roadmap right Instead you're going to use it for the groundwork you're going to use it for the research and then you as the human and your uh you know ability to decide what makes sense and what doesn't you can take these plans and collaboratively refine them until you have something that you're actually happy with right So this isn't something that fully replaces this process of product development but instead it significantly uplevels what you and your team can do right When everybody is doing this no longer is it sufficient to just have a PRD or have a plan of what to do instead you need to be able to take that plan and go way further and this is really going to become the new standard for working i already kind of touched on a bit of how the planning process is going to change but we really think that this uh is important to internalize like if you are able to pull in customer interviews uh architecture documents ideas about how your organization already works transcripts right Then you can pull all that info in and do a sort of collaborative discovery process with agents and the final deliverable yes it's helpful to have the LLM to structure it out you don't have to think as much about certain grammar rules but you should definitely still be interacting and getting yourself involved in this process right And so agents aren't just like an easy solution but instead just really a new way to do this process a couple of things that we always tell organizations you should have these processes internally if you're using agents you should have PRDS you should have engineering design docs you should have RCA templates and quarterly product roadmaps before organizations would see this sort of stuff as overhead it's bureaucracy right But with agent native software development this process and documentation serves as a knowledge base and a map for your agents your droids to imitate the way that your team actually thinks right And so documentation and process is now a conversation with your future developers and your future AI systems last thing I want to talk about is how we transform site reliability engineering incident response and the hardest part of the post uh deployment process which is making sure that things don't break afterwards in this video you can see a droid take an incident from Sentry but this would work for any of your observability platforms your monitoring tools and actually work through the context that's fragmented from across your org right So if you think about it incident response is ultimately a puzzle there's context fragmented from your log system from your historical responses from your codebase and the real problem here is how do we piece these things together in a coherent way If you leverage droids or other agents in your organization when this alert triggers you can pull in that context the system logs the past incidents and you can and the droid can use its tools to actually kind of trace the path through this incident i see that this issue happened here here's the timestamps of when that happened oh there's a file that's related that was just changed by an engineer 3 hours before the incident right That sort of work could save an hour two hours and if you're working on a payment system that does 10 billion transactions an hour right that could be the difference of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars solving the problem now versus in an hour um and so we think that the acceptable time to acknowledgement and time to resolution of agent-driven software organizations can be effectively zero and because droids and other future agents uh have user and organization level memory every interaction that they have with these sorts of problems is building a model of how your team responds how it builds software right We've talked about planning about coding about site reliability when you're when you have agent-driven development processes at your org taking all of these processes together you start to fill in critical gaps that ultimately really only happen in the heads of your engineers right When you have a real software engineer they do all three of these things your droids and your agents should do the same here's kind of you know useful diagram to kind of think about some of this stuff about how context can be gathered how these AI systems can work um and I and I kind of want to talk about one last thing which is you know most importantly we're seeing a shift in organizations from reactive software development to proactive software development right You because you can see all of these patterns across the edgeorg here's where the incidents tend to happen here's where the coding uh you know problems are taking us the longest amount of time here's the bottlenecks in the in the planning and problem solving process then your agents are actually able to surface these things up and so the second third and fourth time that you work on them you're not just going to get a solution of hey here's you know the fourth incident response you're going to get a comment like a proactive engineer would say hey this is the fourth time this happened it might be time to think about how to fix this more systematically right That is the promise of agent-driven software development just some kind of quick final thoughts here in the last minute we think that the amplification of software developers is at the very early days still the least amount of software developers that will ever exist exists today we're probably going to see 10 to 100x more software developers in the future and the best developers that we know are spending far less time writing lines of code writing documents by hand and far more time thinking about how they can automate and manage agents in their software life cycle they're busy thinking about what the opportunity is and less about is my like whole job going to get replaced it's a silly notion right Your job is not going to get replaced by agents it is about to become way more fun to build software and way more fun to build highquality software and the future belongs to agent uh software developers who can use these agents in a way that's effective um if any of this was interesting and you guys want to try the droids you can scan this code and you got 20 million free tokens uh and so feel free to bring this to your org give it a try and see what we mean when we say Asian-driven software development um and first and foremost we're also an enterprise platform so if you're interested in this in a secure deployment we're happy to do that too i've got my email right up there
