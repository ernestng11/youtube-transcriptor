I'll try to cover the things which are new or something which will help us all build uh state-of-the-art so uh I want to start with this slide where uh we want I want to showcase where we are in AI i mean where the world is in AI so open AAI and deep mind define levels of intelligence and they define sort of similar there are five levels of intelligence we are right now in level two between level two and level three level two is about making models understand and do complex tasks level one was basically when charg came it can talk about any topic with you uh level three is when you can build agents which can do complex tasks for you not just solve a problem not just one thing but actually do complex reasoning and that's where uh and and assistance which can do things for you level four is around being uh innovators right now we are seeing early sign of level four where models are starting to generate something new novel ideas but very early so we are not there yet and level five is of course when AI behaves like an institution like an organization and it can sort of act like a company you know can act as an HR can act as an IT can act as an R&D all of that so we are level two uh level three right now close to that and that's what I'm going to cover in today's talk so uh I will not spend much time on this slide but is what is AI agents all of us know here and we have seen talks in fact just MJ's talk was also about healthcare agents uh basically agents which can do task on your behalf on any complex workflow or complex uh which involves complex reasoning uh but before we go there uh as a human right if we want to have our own AI assistants let's say if I have an assistant but if I want to have an AI assistant what do we want an assistant which can order cal for me order food for me buy groceries do research you know and and stuff like that that's the kind of assistant we want which does not exist right now but the question is how to get there and are we on track to building such agents and that's what we'll cover today so question is are the current assistants or AIS are they really personal assistant are they really agentic such that they can replace a human assistant and I would say that we are seeing early signs of it so the way I have defined AI agents is four types the first one is multi- aent or multi- aent system multi- aent assistance which can do complex tasks not just one for example a multi- aent system would be someone which can order food order groceries do a complex math reasoning problem for me look into my calendars schedule meetings order caps all of that right so that's the true assistant which can do many things not just one uh then there is browser based agents i think some of you or most of you would be aware of manusi there are browser which can browse the web and do a complex reasoning do a task it it can take 10 minutes 5 minutes 15 minutes to solve a task but it can do that that's browser based agents limited in some capacity because they cannot they're not as fast as let's say a human would or let's say if I want to buy a smartphone I will simply go on Amazon and do it in one or two minutes maybe 5 minutes but something like a browser agent which can do it it will take 10 minutes 15 minutes and maybe it might even fail because it was not able to do transaction so we are seeing early signs of browser agents but they are not fully usable they will be but not for real-time use cases then there is this general purpose AI which is chat GPI these systems are intelligent they can do one thing at a time but they're not fully agentic to sort of book a cab for you and stuff like that but they're really smart they are the core intelligence level and the fourth one is ondevice agents or assistants we know Alexa we know Google assistant we know Siri they are there but very very transactional can't do multi-step reasoning and all that but they are still there they were the early science of assistants in fact I happen to be build Alexa so they were early science of assistants they are not great at reasoning but good at some tasks so uh this is the example of browser agents not doing well uh for example I asked Manus hey manus can you book me a cab or order food it was not able to do it because it does not have connection to APIs or payments and stuff like that and even to get to this it take minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes so essentially we are seeing that AI is moving forward but is it truly AI assistant is it truly something which is consumercentric is it something which can actually replace uh you know my other assistant or let's say myself the things which I'm doing to further deep down I want to showcase the four types in this category basically if you look at here to is one assistant which is multi- aent it can do many many things you and the on the left side you see dimensions such as personalization speed cost accuracy complex reasoning use cases uh and on the right side that you see the columns are different assistants so criti One of the things which my team built at Kitim we launched it last week i will show a demo of that in the next slide there's manus which I just talked about manus is great it can do any task or most tasks which are on the web but not very fast with low accuracy but eventually they will become fast cheap as well as more accurate still there is inherent limitation because manus does not have access to APIs it cannot do transactions fully for you then there's Gemini in charge as you see they are great in intelligence again they are not agentic and also they cannot cover all the use cases that let's say if I want to book a cab I cannot do that with Gemini or chat GBD and Alexa and Siri exists we all know them they are simple great at those small uh simple experiences but for complex task it cannot do a thing so this is criti which we built it is a multi- aent AI assistant which can do many things uh for you they said in the future AI would make life easy Meet Krui India's first AI assistant [Music] order two chicken biryani and a mint lime juice from Maidas sure thing enjoy mi [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hey Ki take me to Kora Mangla social [Applause] [Music] India's first EI I assistant so uh this is a glimpse of what we built it is functional it works uh for almost English plus 11 languages i would like to cover how we build this and what currently lags in existing existing agents as well as assistants so uh to build this kind of complex system you need an AI that knows you it needs to have a memory it needs to know what your preferences are it needs to know the transactions that you you have made in the past if my assistant a real assistant a human assistant would know my payments would know I like vegetarian would know my favorite restaurants would know the kind of groceries or I do groceries every once once every week if these kind of information exists or is known to an AI it will be truly personal and therefore cut down the time cost and exper and help you build a great experience then uh we we also leverage MCPS so MCP are this model context protocols these are the advanced APIs if you want to build any application you need to have APIs to access data to access payments and bunch of that stuff those things don't exist they don't those things don't work very well for agentic or LLM era because in the new era you need to pass a lot of context you need to pass information you need to uh do transactions which are just beyond rest API calls and for that you need MCPS it has a standard structure yeah there's a server there is a host there is a client they communicate with multiple LLMs to make this happen and we leverage MCP to bring different capabilities like cabs groceries food like I can have an MCP from Amazon I can have an MCP for uh uh PayPal for payments and so on and with those MCPS I can bring those the the holistic experience for building a true AI assistant then there is uh agent to agent protocols now because what we have built is a multi- aent framework you need to have many many agents working together let's say if I order food food will require an agent which can understand what you are looking for the kind of uh uh food that you want to eat then you also want to place an order that's an order agent you also want an agent which can uh track your payments make the payments and also track your order and get it to your home or wherever you place the order so you need multiple agents that work together and for that you need a protocol it was built by Google agent to agent protocol we built that and use that to actually make multiple agents coordinate together and and complete the task this is the agentic intelligence that we have built essentially I will walk you through an example if I say I'm hungry then there is this agentic intelligence which will break the task into multiple subtasks then uh MCPS are basically different API calls or different systems it will help me order the kind of food I'm looking for managing my order and so on and then this agent to agent protocols will manage all these agents to complete the task and then towards the end we have a complete we have an a verifier which verifies the task and make sure that it is uh ordered it ordered what you actually are looking for uh to bring all these things together uh this is the architecture of what we built essentially you have uh multimodal input layer and a true agent can consume text it can consume voice it can consume my documents it can consume uh my images if I'm playing my order if I'm placing if I want to pay my bills if I want a to understand my documents my thesis and so on it needs to be multimodal so we have a multimodal models multimodal input layer which consumes all the data and then there is this orchestrator this orchestrator takes a task and then breaks into multiple smaller tasks as I said in case of food ordering shipping payment and so on so on uh so it breaks that into multiple tasks and then you have multiple agents you have agents which can manage your computer it can browse web you want agent which can do coding because it might do some intelligence on the back you also want agents to understand uh the files that you pass and so on so you have multiple agents that work together to make an experience and towards the end you have a multimodal output layer which generates the output the output can be text it could be voice it could be reports and so on so this is what we built and with that we built the first world's first fully multi- aent consumer assistant it's also available on play store Android as well as iOS as well as web uh please try it and give us feedback",
