    "aggregated_text": "good afternoon hi I'm David from Paris AI right now legacy cyber security is failing 73% of companies are still using tools built in 2010 meanwhile the bad guys are already using AI to break into companies faster than any human team can respond your firewalls and antivirus from 2010 are a piece of paper against this AI powered attack so we built Paris AI Fusion it's an agentic AI orchestration platform that detect responds and adapts to cyber threats in real time it hyperautomates your security workflows and lets you put in AI agents to work alongside your security teams now let's dive into some of the powerful features that we have creating playbooks used to be a tedious task but with playbook wizard that we have it now feels like you have an experts a blue team analyst building it for you even better she provides intelligent suggestions on how to improve your playbook based on your auto scan topology you can add orchestration agent and chain it with other specialized AI agents to make smarter faster decisions with 50 plus integrations available out of the box boss our platform can automatically distribute cases to the most relevant agents you have deployed you get full visibility into how many agents are actively working which case are they handling and the real-time triage and prioritizations process now each case is tracked across its life cycle so you always know what stage it's in and what's next and what makes it beautiful is actually your human security team can chat and work side by side with AI agents as if they were additional team members now welcome to the era of collaborations between human and agentic eye collaborations the results faster meanantime to detect with less people or I could say the same team size now could handle more tasks and 46% less total cost of ownerships now the team who built this is a group of hackers engineers data scientists and AISOs with a combined experience of 30 years in cyber security industries from world AI awards in KH France to a regional award at cyber security event in Hanoi Vietnam it is a proof that we are not only building another AI platform we solve particular problems in real world of cyber security 19 enterprise clients choose PRAI to define to defend what matters most from banks governments agencies hospitals and manufacturers now these are not pilot projects these are production environments and we are securing real infrastructures every single day we serve the often neglected mid-market segment globally offer 25,000 mid-market enterprise fall into our sweet spot big security vendors don't serve them we do and this midsize enterprise are too big to stay unprotected but too small for implementing complex enterprise solutions in less than 23 months we hit $1 million in annual current account revenue all with initial funding of 500K we raised two and a half years ago and now we are entering our next growth phase we are raising $3 million to scale to 150 clients and reach $9 million AR by 2027 the funds will go into three core areas product development to reach full agentic AI autonomy sales engine scaling from three proof of concepts to up to 50 PC's per month and building four specific vertical squads targeting BFSI healthcare manufacturing and governments with dedicated gotom market teams we welcome partners who want to join our journey so thank you but wait wait Paul I still got time yes you still got time there's one more thing this is a very important questions I have to you guys there are only two type of companies in this world those who have been hacked or those who don't know yet they have been hacked which one are you or if you are investors ask your portfolio companies so thank you excellent presentation and super important topic especially for myself um how does it compare to comparable products like let's say trend micro with their cybertron or vision one that would be one thing um I would also like to understand the connectors is primarily lock connectors i saw elastic search being in there does it go also on instance for example and lastly the pricing model is something I want to want to know more about sure thanks so the first thing that I want to address is actually the target market between trend micro and Paris AI we serve more into the mid-market enterprises which they don't have a big budgets for cyber security not for a complex enterprise solutions and we also have out of the box 50 50 plus cyber tools that can connect instantly so before you implement uh Parisai hyper automation platform within your within your infrastructures we pre-scan your topology if we miss something you can put uh credentials of cyber tools that you have and then when you create a playbook based on uh the infrastructures our playbook wizards will develop it for you and give you better recommendations because we have already served like 19 clients mid enter enterprises and almost 35 others small medium business like startups so and then the pricing model we do license yearly base starting from 40k $40,000 up to $125 with annual contract value currently around $60,000 do do you intend to do as a bit of a pay as you go or you prefer to do it yearly licensing as of now I think I believe that the the best business model is actually to be uh licensed to be able to utilize the whole and you get the whole experience of using the hyper automation platforms but in the futures I think that's also an interesting model because then you can deploy on a cloud pay as you go the token that kind of thing thank you hey I noticed most of your customers at the moment are Indonesian um what does it take for you to win another market say the US yes that's an interesting questions so for us our strategy now is because our turf is Southeast Asia we would like to be better uh gear up within our own home country 80% of our customers are located in Indonesia 20% in Singapore and Philippines starting next month actually we are going to do implementation in Middle East there are two customers there in Saudi Arabia and Jordan the way how we going to scale this is actually we become a principle that's how we has always been we always work together with distributor and partners who has capabilities and strong point in certain regions even in Indonesia even in Singapore even in Philippines we also partners with distributors SI and another partners wait out of your 1 million ARR is it all recurring it's all recurring 80% of the AR is recurring but another 20% is professional services that we do for onetime implementation fee consulting that kind of thing but it's out of the recurrent uh the current recurrent revenue of $1 million AR right um and and in terms of uh the sales cycle how how does it look like yes that's the caveat up to 6 months or two quarters but then it's getting faster because my hypothesis is either we are still in the early phase we are still looking for the best model to serve our customers it's getting faster but day by day for example in the beginning it's up to two quarters but now customers that is inbounding into our platforms can go live and start licensing in up to 3 weeks after doing all the integ Gracious and hyper that we do within the 3 weeks",
