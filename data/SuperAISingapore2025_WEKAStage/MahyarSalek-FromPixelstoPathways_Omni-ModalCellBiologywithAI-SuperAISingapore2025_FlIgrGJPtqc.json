    "aggregated_text": "good afternoon everyone i'm Mayor Salik president and CTO of Deep Cell it's a pleasure to be here at SuperAI Singapore to share a bold vision about biology how AI is not just reading biology but starting to write it today I want to show you how we can go from raw cell images to predictive insights and why this may be the tipping point for true biological intelligence so let's get started so when we think about cells we often reduce them to genes pathways markers but there's an ancient language that's always been there morphology the shape the texture and the structure of the cell basically what comes to the eye morphology encodes type state and the function of the cell it's quote unquote the phenotype in full resolution and it's massively underexploited by the modern biologists this is actually my favorite cell this is called dendritic cell and it looks like the bath lofah there's a reason that it looks like a bath lofah because it acts like a ba bath lofah they're both designed to maximize the surface in this case to find the foreign agents running in your body so just by looking at it you actually would understand what the cell does and now we're in the journey of make this AI understandable look at these two cells these are images captured with our technology same type one is drugresistant the other one is drug sensitive the difference is visually detectable but subtle and until recently only a trained eye a cyto pathologist or a painstaking assay could tell them apart now AI can pick patterns that even experts miss across millions of cells this is morphology at machine scale so the question is what story does each cell morphology tell us morphology by the way shows up everywhere in the literature so in studies of cell differentiation growth heterogeneity aector function quality control and even target identification but it's often treated as anecdotal and quantitative qualitative and that's the problem we're here to change that to make morphology quantitative highdimensional and actionable just like genomics was 20 years ago in our body we have an estimated number of 100 trillion cells and look just the beautiful hetrogenity in this picture so every single cell has a has a story behind it each one has its own morphology changing over time in context imagine just like how we train chat GPT over the vast amount of internet data now imagine you point that technology inwards to your body and just let AI understand what's going on within your body that's the scale and that's the promise of what we call morphomics so we're entering a new curve in biology imagine this is a distribution of what was observable and so far with everything that we've done in advancing the science of understanding what cells look like and what does it mean we are here in the early part of the distribution because that's what accessible to human beings and that's how we arrived at that we like sit around a bunch of microscopes discuss okay so this is what I'm seeing this is what you're seeing and basically we learned this part now AI is going to take us to the tail of this distribution and let us understand the rare disease the variance of unknown significance as they call it and this is what we're building at Deepell so an end-to-end platform that images single cells one at a time in high throughput extracts morphological features using AI and physically sorts the cells in real time based on that understanding understanding of morphology this is our product our first product called REMI it's a real time cell analyzer and sorter so what do you see here so we plug the sample in each cell runs through an imaging area and we image them one cell at a time and based on the AI inference we sort these cells we physically move them to different buckets so we image every cell at 60,000 frames per minute and run inference on chip and then route each cell based on their morphology it's label free labor free in both sense in biological sense and in AI sense real time AIdriven seytometry and sorting it's like fluorescent cytometry except there's no fluorescent signal it's all microscopy and AI all this content gets to our cloud we call it Axon and you can visualize annotate explore highdimensional morphology in real time so basically the user goes be like well I want to sort this group of cell and then the instrument goes and just sort that cell based on how they look like and finally this is a snapshot of what's going on inside the machine so the cells flow we track them we have a laser system to track and based on the appearance of the cell and the AI inference we sort them through different channels okay now that we understand the technology let's talk about just one application so at Arasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam Netherlands Dr dr vanderpek and Dr croningan are using REMI to detect early kidney transplant and rejection from blood so no biopsy no messing with your body no waiting to see the result of that just a simple blood draw they received their REMI last year and the early results are gamechanging okay so what's the problem in transplant medicine the biggest dilemma is balancing imunosuppression so once you receive the transplant organ so how much imunosuppressant you have to take and there's no good way to understand it so too little the patient rejects the organ too much you invite infection cancer diabetes all sort of complications today's monitoring tools are slow and invasive and we can certainly do better our approach aims to make rejection detectable early painlessly and frequently so the results better patient outcomes fewer biopsies and reduced cost of care just in the country of Netherlands alone this is saving $100 million manually from the cost of the health care system just in one small country and preventing thousands of unnecessary procedure let's look and see how our colleagues at the Arasmus Medical Center discovered a distinct morphoype they playfully call it Mickey Mouse cells look at the two ears appearing on the cells these are the type of immune cells called natural killer cells and they develop these ears that correlates strongly with rejection cases so it wasn't engineer it was learned by the AI and morphomics enables predictive diagnostic at the single level single cell level without labels without guesswork without all that painstaking assay development okay now let's talk about where are we heading so we keep talking about when are we going to achieve super intelligence at bi with biology we are at the verge of super intelligence and that's because in contrast to a lot of AI work that we are evolved to do them but AI is taking taking it from us we're not evolved to understand DNA sequence we're not evolved to understand cell morphology we're not evolved to understand gene expressions and that's why we're already at the verge of super intelligence we're going to very soon learn biology in a very different way that we've already uh developed a unified virtual cell model train across all modalities by modalities I mean genomics proteomics morphology spatial spatial proteomics so a unified cell model is where we are heading to a foundation model for cell think about it as GPT for cells and that model will be capable of reasoning predicting and simulating so ultimately instead of taking one biological experiment and try it very hard in the lab growing the cells you know having your cells die having it uh you know taking care by um somebody who doesn't really understand how to work with it all of that now you have all of that in silicone you have all of that within a computer simulation and you could do all sort of tests you could add a drug to the to your virtual cell and see how the cell behaves you could create a virtual cell model of your body and right now you know our our social network treats us very individually we're like well you know you like ABC that's why I'm going to show you this feed you're like XYZ i'm going to show you this other feed funny enough our healthcare right now treats us all the same if we have a disease we're going to just take the same medicine that and every everyone else even though our body is unique and that's is going to change very soon we're going to have we're going to get personalized medicine using these virtual models so with a virtual cell model we can begin to build digital twins of the biology tailor therapies to individuals personalized medicine and design and manufacture cell therapies that maintain youth resilience and immune balance this isn't science fiction this is the logical in endpoint of multimodel AI native biology so what does what does this all mean this is my last slide so AI isn't just accelerating biology it's changing how we think about life itself as something we can read write design and engineer we believe cell morphology will sits alongside genomics and transcrytoics and that's what our technology is enabling at deep cell so if you are in this space come and talk to us we have commercialized our product and we are right now present globally so this will be a new pillar of biological understanding and the best part we're just getting started this is mourning in biology and biology is now a data science problem is no longer a trial and error
