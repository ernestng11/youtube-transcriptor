    "aggregated_text": "so I'm going to start by making a fairly bold statement Think of never mind as the PayPal for AI agents And I'd ask everyone to keep this analogy in mind throughout the pitch And another thing that often the simplest ideas are also the biggest opportunities I'd like to also clarify I think of AI agents as a superset for AI Agents are actually just models plus some combination of tools and services In fact I have a prediction that within a year from now AI and agents will be seen as synonymous terms that are used interchangeably The only reason I'm making this point on this slide is just to say that the opportunity for agents is actually as big as the entire AI industry itself So let's think from a theoretical point of view AI needs a new payment framework Let's start by considering the anatomy of an agent An agent is a combination of models tools and services and they often employ dynamic combinations of these in order to service an input request This means that each input request has variable operating costs and any sustainable pricing model should surely account for this through some kind of pay as you go pricing scheme But what's the current paradigm the reality is it's a straight read across from SASbased markets fixed monthly subscriptions with some kind of high usage threshold This either p price gouges your hobbyists or loses your shirt with your power users Ultimately we think agents are going to become uncompetitive unless they consider transitioning to an alternative usagebased pricing model So we've established also on the previous slide that cost is important in considering a pricing framework and that the market is and will continue to shift from fixed to variable pricing There's also evidence that builders want to partner with someone that can help them with this transition I say this from our early evidence We think of Nevermind as a costing engine We're building a costing engine to power usagebased pricing In fact we feel that the new standard or baseline for pricing will be usagebased billing to cover at a minimum costs and protect margin The story around usage based billing is only the beginning Pricing doesn't stop there Everyone here has probably had a discussion at some point around outcomebased pricing What we like to think of as valuebased pricing This prices the agent based on the actual value it delivers Now in the next iteration of the pricing framework we see a combination of a base request fee This is the cost covering part of the exercise and some sort of outcomebased success fee What's critically important to note here is that it is still the vendor that is actually setting the price in consultation with their users It's not Nevermind but in the medium term as I already said Nevermind sees itself as a costing engine This means it's able to calibrate fixed usage based pricing to cover costs And in the not too distant future the idea around value based pricing is to actually be able to verify value delivered and charge the customers accordingly I'd just like to make a little note around the way we see uh pricing agents as actually not a function of the human capital costs that they're displacing This is a sort of rookie mistake that we think many people in the market are are making at the minute Basing agent prices on equivalent human labor costs will not hold up for long We're entering a machine economy Services will become at least to some degree commoditized and prices will drop Now I'm not saying it's a race to the bottom but it's definitely a race to somewhere close to the bottom Certainly we're talking about slim margins So let's just recap on Nevermind Nevermind has three pricing modalities: usage outcome and valuebased Nevermind's product toolbox also consists of two modules Nevermind ID is a compliant friendly digital ID stack Nevermind pay breaks down as three product pillars price and margin setting margin setting and licensing Licensing is token gating this kind of thing Usage metering and payments and lastly analy analytics and reporting the latter very important for like recycling that data into optimizing your pricing strategy moving forward Our go-to market strategy is super simple We work with wellunded startups building great agents who are at the minute likely monetizing through fixed monthly subscriptions What's our value prop we want to become their trusted payment partner Transitioning them to real time metering and billing and settlement We're also not afraid of enterprise We have a game plan there too We think incumbents will be forced to adopt some form of usage based pricing to maintain competitiveness to make sure they're profitable and in the face of customers increasingly demanding some kind of valuebased alternative We have a little bit of special source here in the mix as well And to be honest the partners really love this If you're a Nevermind partner we're basically exposing you to a growing network of AI agents a multi- aent system I mean this is what we're all talking about and there's not much evidence of this yet Yeah we know about agent A to A and we know about Anthropics MCP service but as I understand it currently there's not much activity in multi- aent systems Maybe a lack of payments infrastructure is one of those reasons So any agent in our network can cross-ell services that they alone can't provide This effectively expands every partner's capabilities and very importantly it allows them to maintain full ownership of their existing client relationships Very very important especially for enterprise Now no business model comes without risks and our risk surely is from the large incumbents Think of Salesforce their agent force platform and their recent announcement around flex credits They have created a closed pay-to-play ecosystem So even the big enterprise are realizing that usage based pricing is critically important Thank you very much Robin Time's up 7 and 1/2 minutes It goes by faster than you think Judges over to you Um just great Love love love what you're trying to do Sure Why why would why would why would I not implement the payment myself like basically I I I like the idea of a PayPal for agents but if I build my agents why wouldn't I do that myself and secondly what would be some of the KPIs on the outcome fees like how would you measure that yeah absolutely So on the outcomebased side that's entirely up to the um the builders of the agents themselves We just provide payment infrastructure We do have a vision that in the medium term it'll actually be be possible to fully verify value especially if it's onchain So there can be some sort of predes predetermined like profit split or if there's like a specific time saved there may be um a pre-existing agreement on how that time transferred into value in terms of building stuff yourself Look this stuff seems simple from the outset Um but actually like um there's minimum threshold to like payment amounts So we're talking about like transactions or if we're at a request level it might be fractions of a cent Um and then you need some kind of upfront credits based payment which you draw down against through redemptions or you need to bill in a rears But ultimately you need to be metering this stuff in real time and batching and aggregating that you just once you actually start to think about it it's not so straightforward to build yourself You've got the access control authentication You've got um we've got evidence from very wellunded like west coast startups that they actually like using the third party for trust reasons And the most important point is this point about cost observability I spoke a lot about actually like like giving a lot of visibility on cost and this is something that like practically no agent builders in the space are actually um really that focused on I just also want to say that I was very much almost finished on my presentation So please don't feel that you've missed out on anything You got everything important in that run of slides",
